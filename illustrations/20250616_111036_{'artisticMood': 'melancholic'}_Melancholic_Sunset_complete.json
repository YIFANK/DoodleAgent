The rough hachure and high roughness further emphasise the raw, turbulent emotions associated with melancholy.

Its vertical orientation symbolizes the weight and depth of this emotion. The dark, bluish stroke color and the earthy, aqua green fill color convey a sense of heaviness and serenity, respectively.

The choice of a darker blue (#264653) for the stroke signifies the depth of melancholy while the slightly more uplifting green (#2A9D8F) used for the fill represents the individual's yearnings for hope. The roughness and bowing parameters have been chosen to provide an intentional imbalance, implying the struggle with sadness.
