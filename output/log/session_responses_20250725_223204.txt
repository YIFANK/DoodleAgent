Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "The ocean scene has evolved beautifully with multiple layers of waves, seaweed, and light reflections. To complete the composition, I'll add one final long, graceful wave at the bottom using the lightest Keppel shade (#E1F1ED). This gentle undulating line will serve as a soft foundation for all the elements above it, creating a sense of depth and completing the underwater atmosphere. The placement will be low on the canvas, stretching across most of the width to ground the entire piece.",

Raw Response:
{
    "thinking": "Looking at the serene ocean scene, I notice we could add some delicate depth to the mid-right section. I'll use the wiggle brush with a subtle Keppel light shade to create a soft, floating seaweed tendril that gently curves upward. This will help fill the negative space between existing elements while maintaining the peaceful underwater atmosphere. The placement will create a natural flow with the other seaweed forms.",

  "thinking": "Looking at the peaceful ocean scene with its layers of waves, seaweed, and light reflections, I notice an opportunity to add another gentle underwater element. I'll create a delicate seaweed tendril using a light Keppel shade, positioned in the mid-left area where there's some open space. This will help balance the composition by adding a subtle organic form that mirrors the existing seaweed shapes on the right.",
