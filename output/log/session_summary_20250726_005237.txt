To complete this aquatic composition, I'll add one final wave pattern using a darker shade of Keppel (#387766) between the remaining wave gaps. This will fill the last open space in our pattern and create perfect visual balance, with alternating colors and depths suggesting the complex layers of ocean waves. This final addition will be positioned precisely between the remaining waves where there's still space.
