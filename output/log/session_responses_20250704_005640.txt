Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank canvas, which offers endless possibilities. I'll start by creating a dynamic flowing line that will serve as the foundation for an abstract composition. I'll use the wiggle brush with a soothing Keppel color to create an organic, wave-like motion that sweeps across the canvas from left to right, starting in the upper third of the canvas.",

Question: What would you like to draw next?
Canvas: output/20250704_005644/canvas_step_1.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice a small dot in the upper left portion of an otherwise blank canvas. Let's create a flowing, organic composition starting from that point. I'll use the wiggle brush with a serene Keppel color to create a graceful descending curve that will establish movement and direction in the piece.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice a flowing aqua wiggle line in the upper portion of the canvas. To create visual balance and expand the composition downward, I'll add a complementary curved element below it using the Sky Blue palette. This will create a sense of movement and depth while maintaining harmony with the existing strokes.",
