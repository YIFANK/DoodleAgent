I'll create an ethereal mist that dances through the rainbow arc, using the spray brush to add atmospheric depth and mystery to the composition.

"reasoning": "Gossamer spray creates ethereal veil beneath chromatic arc - slow timing (3-4) builds dreamy atmosphere while following golden curve of existing rainbow"
}

The gentle spray pattern will follow the natural curve beneath the rainbow circles, creating a unifying misty foundation that enhances the magical quality of the scene. The slower timing values allow the spray particles to accumulate with atmospheric intention, while the coordinates trace a graceful complementary arc that embraces and elevates the existing composition.
