Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I'm looking at a blank white canvas, which offers endless possibilities. I'll start by creating a dynamic, sweeping gesture that will serve as the foundation for an abstract composition. I'll use the wiggle brush with a calming Keppel color to draw a flowing curved line that moves across the middle section of the canvas, suggesting movement and energy.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a single wiggly teal line traversing the middle of the canvas. To create an interesting composition, I'll add a complementary wiggly line in a contrasting warm color (Light Red) slightly below the existing line. This will create a sense of movement and rhythm while maintaining balance. The new line will follow a similar wavelength pattern but with its own unique character.",

Canvas: output/20250712_154943/canvas_step_2.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe two parallel wavy lines - one in teal/keppel and one in light red, creating a rhythmic pattern. To build on this musical, wave-like composition, I'll add another complementary wave pattern above the existing ones using a contrasting warm color (jasmine) to create a harmonious tricolor arrangement. This will add depth and complete the visual rhythm while maintaining adequate spacing between the lines.",

Canvas: output/20250712_154943/canvas_step_3.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe three wavy lines arranged horizontally across the canvas - a yellow/jasmine line at the top, a teal/keppel line in the middle, and a coral/light red line at the bottom. To add more visual interest and continue the rhythmic pattern, I'll add a gentle purple wisteria wave that weaves between these existing lines, creating a dynamic interplay of colors. I'll position it in an open space, slightly offset from the others to create depth.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe three wavy lines in different styles: a uniform yellow wave at the top, an intertwined teal and purple wave pattern in the middle, and a coral/light red wave at the bottom. To add visual interest and balance, I'll create another intertwined wave pattern below the bottom red line, using Sky Blue and Wisteria to mirror the middle section's complexity but with different colors. This will create a satisfying bookend effect.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe four parallel wavy lines spanning horizontally across the canvas in yellow, teal/purple, light red, and sky blue. The middle line has an interesting interweaving pattern with teal and wisteria colors. To create a balanced composition, I'll add a final darker, grounding line below the sky blue one, using dark wisteria (#5E1586) to add visual weight to the bottom of the piece. This will help anchor the composition while maintaining the rhythmic wave pattern.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe several parallel wavy lines in various colors creating a rhythmic pattern. To add visual interest and maintain the established rhythm while introducing variation, I'll add a more dynamic wiggly line in wisteria purple that weaves between the existing lines, starting from y-coordinate 290. This will help fill the slight gap in the middle section while adding a new layer of movement to the composition.",
