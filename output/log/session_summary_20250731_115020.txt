Brush: wiggle
Color: #132822
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Since the canvas is blank, I want to create a whimsical tree using the 'wiggle' brush. I'll start by drawing the trunk using a dark shade of Keppel for a unique look. The trunk will be placed towards the left center of the canvas.

Thinking: Now, I want to add some foliage to the tree to create a whimsical effect. I'll use the 'wiggle' brush with a default Keppel color for the leaves. I plan to make several wavy lines radiating outwards from the top of the trunk to give it a playful, flowing appearance.

Thinking: To add more depth to the whimsical tree, I'll add a few more leaves to create a fuller look. I'll use the 'wiggle' brush with a lighter Keppel color to add some variation and dimension. These strokes will be interspersed between the existing leaves to enhance the visual richness.

Thinking: To enhance the whimsical tree, I'll add some flowers to bring a touch of color. I'll use the 'crayon' brush with a Jasmine color to create small blossoms around the foliage. This will add visual interest and make the design more vibrant.

Strokes: 2
Thinking: To expand the whimsical tree, I'm going to add some small branches using the 'wiggle' brush with a Sky Blue color. These branches will radiate outward from the foliage, adding more complexity and texture to the tree. I'll place them slightly above the existing foliage.

Strokes: 3
Thinking: To give the whimsical tree a more finished look, I'll add some small details resembling fruit or additional blossoms using the 'crayon' brush in Tea Rose (Red) color. These spots will add more vibrancy and enhance the playful effect. I'll place them dispersed within the foliage area.

Color: #288AAB
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To enhance the whimsical tree further, I'll add a few more branches on the left side using the 'wiggle' brush with a darker Sky Blue color. This will create a more balanced look by extending the tree's composition. These branches will curve outward from the main foliage.

Brush: crayon
Color: #CF94EE

Thinking: To bring more life to the whimsical tree, I'll add some extra blossoms using the 'crayon' brush in Wisteria color. I'll place these near the existing blossoms to create a beautiful color contrast and fullness.

Strokes: 1
Thinking: To add more vibrancy and harmony to the whimsical scene, I'm going to draw a sun in the top right corner using the 'crayon' brush in Jasmine color. This will balance the composition and give a warm contrast to the tree. I'll create a circular shape with rays extending outward.
