Since we're starting with a blank canvas, let's create something playful and dynamic! I'll draw a flowing rainbow wave across the canvas.

{
  "brush": "rainbow",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [50, 200, 425, 650, 800],
      "y": [250, 150, 350, 200, 300],
      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "flowing wave"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Creating a dynamic rainbow wave to add vibrant energy and movement to the empty canvas"
}
