Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "The blank canvas seems to mirror the emptiness often felt during sadness. To capture this feeling, I'll draw a series of descending lines, representing tears falling. I'll use the 'fountain' brush in black for an elegant yet somber effect. I'll start at the top center of the canvas and create descending strokes, emphasizing the vertical descent. This will convey the weight of sadness pulling downwards.",
