Raw Response:

  "thinking": "The canvas is completely blank, giving us a fresh start. I'll begin by creating a gentle, wave-like pattern using the wiggle brush in a calming sky blue color. This will establish a flowing, organic base element positioned in the lower portion of the canvas, suggesting water or a peaceful landscape element.",
