Brush: crayon
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: The blank canvas feels like it needs something warm and friendly to start with. I chose the jasmine yellow crayon to create a simple, cheerful curved line that could be the beginning of many different drawings. The slow timing ensures a smooth, deliberate curve.

Brush: crayon
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a complementary teal arc above the existing yellow curve creates a pleasing abstract face-like composition. The slower timing creates smooth curves that mirror the existing stroke while the cooler color provides nice contrast.

------------------------------

Brush: crayon
Color: #FFD1D1
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a gentle pink curve below the yellow smile creates a sweet, rosy cheek effect that enhances the warm, friendly feeling. The careful positioning below the existing elements maintains balance while adding a soft, playful touch.

------------------------------

Brush: wiggle
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a whimsical wiggling eyebrow will give the face more character. The wiggle brush creates a perfect expressive brow, and using the same teal color ties it to the upper arc. Positioned carefully above the yellow curve to maintain facial proportions.

------------------------------

Brush: wiggle
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a symmetrical wiggly eyebrow on the right side to balance the existing left eyebrow. Using the same teal color and wiggle brush for consistency, positioned at the same y-height but offset to the right for proper facial symmetry.

------------------------------

[2025-06-24 13:36:29] Step
Brush: marker
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a simple curved eye on the left side to complete the face features. Using marker for a bold, defined look in teal to match the existing color scheme. Positioned carefully between the eyebrow and smile.

------------------------------

[2025-06-24 13:36:41] Step
Brush: marker
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding the right eye to balance the face. Using marker with Keppel green to match the existing eye style. Positioned carefully to maintain facial symmetry with the left eye, curving gently for a friendly expression.

------------------------------

[2025-06-24 13:36:51] Step
Brush: marker
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a cheerful yellow connection between the two faces creates a sense of unity and joy. The marker's smooth flow helps create a gentle, floating bridge effect in a warm jasmine yellow that complements the existing elements.
