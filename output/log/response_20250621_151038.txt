I'm suggesting this stroke to create a mirror reflection of the existing rainbow arc, establishing a harmonious circular composition. The slow timing allows the rainbow colors to emerge gradually and blend naturally with the existing spray particles, while the curved path complements and balances the upper arc. This creates a sense of cosmic wholeness, like a celestial portal or energy field suspended in space.
