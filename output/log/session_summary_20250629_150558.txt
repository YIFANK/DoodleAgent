Brush: marker
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 4
Thinking: I'll draw a classic happy face on the blank canvas using marker brush. I'll start with a large circle for the face outline in a cheerful yellow, then add eyes and a smile in a dark blue to create contrast. The face will be centered in the canvas for maximum impact.
