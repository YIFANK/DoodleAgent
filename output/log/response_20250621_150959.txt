I'll create a complementary arc of sprayed particles to mirror and enhance the existing rainbow formation, using the spray brush to add depth and atmospheric texture.

{
    "brush": "spray",
    "strokes": [
        {
            "x": [50, 425, 800],
            "y": [400, 450, 400],
            "t": [4, 4],
            "description": "misty rainbow echo"
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "Creating ethereal counterpoint beneath existing arc - spray particles at t=4 build dreamy atmosphere while following golden ratio curve for harmony"
}
