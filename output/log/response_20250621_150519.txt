I notice this piece has a beautiful organic flow with orange wiggly lines and soft peachy circular markers. I'll continue this rhythmic pattern with complementary elements.

      "y": [350, 380, 390, 370, 320],
      "t": [4, 3, 4, 3],

    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Adding flowing wiggle stroke to mirror existing curves, positioned in lower canvas (Y:320-390) to balance composition, using slow timing for organic movement"
}

This stroke continues the fluid, organic nature of the existing artwork while adding a complementary curved element in the lower portion of the canvas. The wiggle brush matches the playful quality of the orange lines already present, and the slow timing values (3-4) ensure smooth, natural movement that enhances the overall flow of the piece.

Would you like me to suggest another complementary stroke to further develop this artistic expression?
