Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "To express happiness, I'll create a dynamic, upward-sweeping composition using vibrant, cheerful colors. I'll start with a series of ascending curved lines in a joyful Jasmine yellow that suggest upward movement and positive energy. These curves will dance across the canvas like rays of sunshine or waves of laughter, starting from the bottom left and moving upward to the right.",
