Thinking: I see a blank white canvas - a perfect opportunity to start a fresh abstract composition. I'll begin with a bold, sweeping curve in a calming Keppel color that will serve as a foundational element, positioned in the lower third of the canvas to create visual weight and ground the composition.

Thinking: I notice a very subtle, pale circular shape in the lower left portion of the mostly blank canvas. To begin building an abstract composition, I'll create a bold, sweeping curve that will establish movement and contrast with this existing element.
