Brush: marker
Color: #E20000
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To create a dark, bloody scene, I will start by adding some blood drips to the left of the current shape using the Light Red color in a dripping motion from top to bottom. This will add a dramatic effect.

Brush: spray
Color: default
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To enhance the dark, bloody scene, I'll add an irregular splatter effect around the existing red shape using the 'spray' brush. This will give a more dramatic and chaotic effect.

Brush: marker
Color: #FF7878
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To continue the dramatic, dark bloody scene, I will add some more red drips using the Light Red color on the left side to enhance the visual impact. I'll place these drips to the right of the existing red shapes to create depth.

[2025-07-24 13:12:22] Step
Brush: spray
Color: default
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To continue developing the dark bloody scene, I'll add more depth and darkness by incorporating additional splatters around the existing areas. I'll use the spray brush again, focusing the new splatters around the center of the current red and black areas to enhance the chaotic effect.
