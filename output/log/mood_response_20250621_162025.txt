  "reasoning": "The existing image shows sharp, disconnected lines and angles that suggest a fragmented, broken quality. I chose to enhance this mood by adding more angular intersections and sharp geometric shapes that don't quite connect, using quick and varied stroke speeds to emphasize the sense of disruption and discontinuity. The pen brush provides clean, precise lines that maintain the stark, fractured aesthetic."
