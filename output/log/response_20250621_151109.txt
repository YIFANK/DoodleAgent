This celestial arrangement of colorful orbs calls for a complementary element that enhances its ethereal, cosmic quality. I'll create a sweeping arc of stardust to dance through the composition.

"reasoning": "Ethereal spray arc traces constellation path, slow timing (4,5) builds delicate stellar mist. Creates dynamic flow connecting rainbow spheres in cosmic dance"

This spray stroke will sweep gracefully above the existing colorful orbs, adding a unifying element of cosmic movement and mystery. The slow timing allows the particles to build gradually, suggesting the timeless nature of celestial movement. The arc's path reinforces the existing circular composition while adding vertical dynamism.
