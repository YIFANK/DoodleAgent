  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas that offers infinite possibilities. Let's start with a bold, dynamic gesture that will serve as a foundation for our abstract composition. I'll create a sweeping curved line using the marker brush in Wisteria purple, starting from the upper left quadrant and swooping down towards the center. This will establish movement and energy in the piece.",
