I'll create a complementary element that mirrors and enhances the existing rainbow arc pattern, using the spray brush to create a dreamy, particle-based reflection that suggests a complete circle or portal.

{
    "brush": "spray",
    "strokes": [
        {
            "x": [150, 425, 700],
            "y": [450, 480, 450],
            "t": [4, 4],
            "description": "misty reflection"
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "Creating ethereal spray arc below existing rainbow suggests dimensional portal - slow timing (t=4) builds mystical atmosphere and particle density for depth"
}

This will create a subtle, misty reflection below the existing arcs, using the spray brush to generate a soft, particulate curve that completes the circular suggestion. The slow timing allows for proper particle buildup, creating a dreamy, atmospheric quality that enhances the geometric harmony while maintaining visual lightness.
