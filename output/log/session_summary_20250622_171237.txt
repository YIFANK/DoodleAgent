Reasoning: Starting with a cheerful scene - a happy face with wiggly features to add playfulness, some wavy ground, and sun rays to create a joyful morning vibe on the blank canvas

Brush: marker
Color: #8b4513
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a brown tree trunk on the right side to balance the composition and create a complete outdoor scene with the existing sun, clouds, grass, and ground line

------------------------------

Brush: marker
Color: #228B22
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: I see a brown tree trunk on the right side that needs a leafy crown to complete it. I'll add green foliage in a rounded, natural shape above the trunk to create a full tree and enhance the cheerful outdoor scene.

Brush: marker
Color: #ff69b4
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding pink flower stems in the foreground to bring more life and color to the scene. Positioning them diagonally from bottom-left toward the center to create visual flow and complement the existing natural elements like the tree, grass, and clouds.
