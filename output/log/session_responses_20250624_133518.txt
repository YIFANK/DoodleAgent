      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "A gentle upward curved arc like a smile"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "The blank canvas feels like it needs something warm and friendly to start with. I chose the jasmine yellow crayon to create a simple, cheerful curved line that could be the beginning of many different drawings. The slow timing ensures a smooth, deliberate curve."

      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "gentle curved arc above the yellow smile"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Adding a complementary teal arc above the existing yellow curve creates a pleasing abstract face-like composition. The slower timing creates smooth curves that mirror the existing stroke while the cooler color provides nice contrast."
