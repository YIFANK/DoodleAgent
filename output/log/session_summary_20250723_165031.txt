Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 4
Thinking: To express happiness, I'll draw a playful sunshine with wavy rays in the upper portion of the canvas. I'll use bright, cheerful colors from the Jasmine palette. Starting with a circular center around coordinates (425,150) and extending wavy rays outward in a radial pattern. The wiggle brush will create a perfect energetic, joyful effect that captures the spirit of happiness.

Thinking: I see a cheerful sun with wavy rays in the upper portion. To amplify the happy mood, I'll add some bouncy, rolling hills at the bottom of the canvas using the wiggle brush in a soothing Keppel green. The gentle curves will create a peaceful, joyful landscape beneath the sun. I'll make three connected hill curves starting from the bottom, with varying heights to create visual interest.

Thinking: I see a cheerful scene with a bright sun and rolling green hills. To add more joyful energy, I'll draw some playful birds soaring through the sky using the wiggle brush in Sky Blue. I'll create three small birds with curved wing shapes at different heights between the sun and hills, suggesting carefree flight and freedom. Their placement will help connect the upper and lower elements of the composition while adding movement and life to the scene.

Thinking: The scene is already quite joyful with its bright sun, rolling hills, and playful birds. To enhance the happy mood even more, I'll add some bouncing butterflies using the wiggle brush in a cheerful Wisteria purple. I'll place three butterflies in a dancing pattern near the center, with each butterfly made of two small curved wing shapes. Their placement between the birds will add another layer of whimsical movement and joy to the composition.

Thinking: Looking at this joyful scene with its wavy hills, fluttering birds, butterflies and sun, I want to add more radiating happiness from the sun. I'll draw additional wavy rays using the wiggle brush in bright Jasmine yellow, extending outward from the center sun in a star-like pattern. These new rays will amplify the warmth and cheerful energy already present in the composition, making the sun appear to truly beam with joy.

Thinking: Looking at this cheerful landscape, I'd like to add some playful flowers growing from the wavy hills to enhance the happy mood. I'll use the wiggle brush with Light Red to create simple, bouncy flowers with curvy petals springing up from the top wave. I'll place them at different heights to create a natural, joyful rhythm along the hillside.

Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 4
Thinking: The scene is already full of joyful elements! To amplify the happiness, I'll add some playful bouncing flower stems rising up from the flowers we just placed. Using the wiggle brush in a fresh Keppel green, I'll create wavy stems that dance upward from each flower base, adding a sense of growth and whimsical movement. This will connect the flowers to the wavy hills and add more vertical energy to complement the horizontal waves.

Thinking: I notice this joyful scene with its sunshine, wavy ocean, and flowers needs some extra whimsy! I'll add a cute rainbow butterfly using the wiggle brush, placing it near the upper right portion of the scene where it can dance among the existing elements. I'll start with the wing shapes in a cheerful wisteria purple to complement the existing color palette and add to the playful mood.

Thinking: The scene has a cheerful mood with waves, a sun, and a butterfly. Let's add some happy little clouds dancing across the sky using the wiggle brush in Sky Blue. I'll place them at different heights and sizes to create a playful, bouncing rhythm. Some are already there, but adding a few more will enhance the joyful atmosphere and balance the composition. I'll focus on areas that feel a bit empty to maintain visual harmony.

Thinking: The scene is already filled with joyful elements - waves, clouds, sun, and a butterfly. To amplify the happy mood, I'd like to add some bouncing flower heads on top of those green stems we placed earlier. I'll use the wiggle brush with a cheerful Light Red color to create simple, rounded flower shapes that look like they're dancing in the breeze. I'll place one atop each stem, keeping the design playful and loose to match the whimsical nature of the scene.

Thinking: Looking at this delightful scene with its waves, clouds, sun, and single red flower, I want to complete the flower family! I'll add more flower heads on the remaining stems using the wiggle brush with Light Red, placing them atop each empty stem. This will create a harmonious row of blooming flowers that appear to be swaying in the breeze, adding to the joyful atmosphere of the scene.

Thinking: Looking at this cheerful scene with waves, flowers, clouds, and a sun, I want to add more joyful energy! I'll draw some playful sunshine rays using the wiggle brush in a warm Jasmine yellow, extending from the existing sun in the center. These wavy rays will radiate outward in a spiral pattern, creating a sense of warmth and happiness that spreads across the sky. This will enhance the overall joyful mood and complement the existing elements.

Thinking: Looking at this joyful scene, I notice we could add some playful butterflies to complement the existing one. The scene has a lovely balance of waves, flowers, sun and clouds, but adding another small butterfly would create a sense of companionship and movement. I'll use the wiggle brush with Wisteria purple to draw a small butterfly near the right side of the canvas, making it look like it's dancing with the existing one. This will enhance the feeling of joy and lightness in the scene.

Thinking: The scene is filled with such cheerful elements - waves, flowers, sun rays, clouds, and butterflies. To add more joyful energy, I want to create a small group of bouncing bubbles floating up from between the waves. I'll use the wiggle brush with Sky Blue to draw small circular shapes that look like they're floating upward, creating a sense of playful movement and adding to the scene's happy atmosphere. I'll place them rising from between the wave lines on the left side.

Thinking: Looking at this joyful scene, I want to add another happy flower to complete our garden! I notice there's still one stem without a flower head on the far left. I'll use the wiggle brush with Light Red to draw a cheerful flower that matches its siblings, maintaining the consistent size and style. This will complete the row of dancing flowers above the waves, creating a perfect sense of balance and happiness in the scene.
