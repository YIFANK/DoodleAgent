Brush: marker
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a blank canvas, and feeling happy makes me want to start with something bright and cheerful! I'll draw a smiling sun in the upper left portion of the canvas. The sun will be made with a rounded circle and radiating lines for sunbeams to express warmth and joy. Starting with the main circle of the sun around coordinates (150,150) as the center point.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 4
Thinking: I see a soft pink circular shape in the upper left of the canvas. Since I'm feeling happy, I want to transform this into a joyful flower! I'll add cheerful petals radiating outward from the existing shape, using the wiggle brush to create playful, organic-looking petals that express the lightness and fun of happiness. I'll place these petals around the existing shape at (150,150).
