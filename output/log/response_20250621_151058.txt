I'll enhance this cosmic rainbow arc with a complementary spray effect to create more atmospheric depth and ethereal energy. Here's how we can add a dreamy, celestial quality:

{
"brush": "spray",
"strokes": [
{
"x": [50, 425, 800],
"y": [400, 200, 400],
"t": [4, 5],
"description": "stardust arc"
}
],
"reasoning": "Layering delicate spray particles along curved trajectory creates cosmic depth, slow timing (4,5) lets stardust elements build gradually, enhancing ethereal mood"
}

This addition will:
1. Follow the existing rainbow arc's curve but at a different height
2. Use the spray brush to create a misty, star-field effect
3. Move slowly to build up particulate density naturally
4. Complement the existing colored circles without overwhelming them
5. Add depth and movement to the overall cosmic composition

The slow timing values will allow the spray particles to accumulate gradually, creating a sense of atmospheric perspective and dreamy depth that enhances the existing elements while maintaining the piece's delicate balance.
