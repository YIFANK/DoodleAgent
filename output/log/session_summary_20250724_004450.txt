Brush: crayon

Strokes: 2
Thinking: I see a blank canvas which gives me the perfect opportunity to express happiness! I want to draw a big, cheerful sun in the upper right corner as a symbol of joy and positive energy. I'll use the crayon brush with a warm yellow color to create textured, radiant strokes for the sun's circle and its beaming rays spreading outward.

Strokes: 2
Thinking: I notice a cheerful sun has been started in the upper right with teal/turquoise colors. To enhance this happy mood, I'll draw some playful, bouncing clouds below it using a crayon brush. The fluffy, light texture of the crayon will create a whimsical, carefree feeling that matches the joyful theme. I'll position the clouds to look like they're dancing across the sky.

Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a delightful scene developing with a teal sun and flowing cloud shapes. To enhance this happy mood, I want to add a joyful rainbow arc below the leftmost cloud! The rainbow will start below the cloud and curve downward in a big, cheerful arch. I'll use the crayon brush to maintain the soft, playful texture that's already established in the drawing. The curved strokes will create a sense of movement and joy.

Brush: crayon
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a charming scene with a teal sun, flowing clouds, and a rainbow arc developing. To add to this joyful atmosphere, I want to draw a cheerful, bouncing bird on the right side of the canvas! I'll place it near the sun, as if it's dancing in the warm rays. The bird will be simple and whimsical with curved lines to suggest wings in flight, matching the playful mood of the entire composition.

Brush: crayon
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a whimsical scene with teal elements creating a joyful atmosphere. To add more happiness, I'll draw a bouncing, smiling line near the bottom of the canvas - like a happy dancing line that's celebrating! The playful curve will complement the existing elements and add to the cheerful mood. I'll place it lower on the canvas to ground the composition and complete the feeling of joy.
