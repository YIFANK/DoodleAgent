Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I'm looking at a completely blank white canvas. To begin an abstract composition, I'll start with a bold, sweeping curve in a calming Keppel color to establish movement and energy in the upper left quadrant. This will create an initial focal point and suggest a direction for the composition to flow.",
