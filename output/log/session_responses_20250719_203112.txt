Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I'm looking at a blank canvas, which offers endless possibilities. I'll start by creating a dynamic, flowing composition using the wiggle brush. I want to create an organic, wave-like motion that starts from the lower left and sweeps upward toward the right, using a calming Keppel color to establish a serene foundation.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a graceful teal wiggle line ascending diagonally across the canvas. To create an interesting counterpoint, I'll add a complementary wiggle line in a contrasting warm color (Light Red) that descends from upper left to lower right, crossing paths with the existing line. This will create dynamic tension and visual interest through both color contrast and directional opposition.",

Canvas: output/20250719_203117/canvas_step_2.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe two intersecting wiggle lines - one in Keppel and one in Light Red - creating a dynamic X-like composition. To enhance this rhythmic pattern, I'll add a third wiggle line using Jasmine yellow. This new line will start slightly lower on the left side and sweep upward toward the right, parallel to but slightly below the Keppel line. This will create a sense of depth and layered movement, while the warm yellow will complement both existing colors and add a bright, energetic element to the composition.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "Looking at the canvas, I see three intersecting wiggle lines in Keppel, Light Red, and Jasmine creating a dynamic composition. To complete this rhythmic pattern and create balance, I'll add a fourth wiggle line in Sky Blue. This line will parallel the Light Red line but positioned slightly higher, starting from the middle-right and extending upward. This will create a pleasing quaternary color harmony while maintaining the established diagonal flow pattern. The Sky Blue will add a fresh, airy quality to complement the existing warm and cool tones.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "The canvas now shows an engaging composition of intersecting wiggle lines in Keppel, Light Red, Jasmine, and a short Sky Blue accent. To build on this dynamic energy, I'll add another Sky Blue wiggle line extending further to the right and upward, starting where the previous blue line ended. This will help balance the composition by echoing the diagonal movement established by the other lines while adding more presence to the cooler tones in the upper right quadrant.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "Looking at the current composition with its interweaving wiggle lines in Keppel, Light Red, Jasmine, and Sky Blue, I notice that the upper right quadrant could benefit from additional visual weight to balance the composition. I'll add a Wisteria purple wiggle line that starts near where the other lines converge and extends upward and rightward. This will introduce a new, rich color to the palette while maintaining the established diagonal flow. The purple will add an elegant contrast to the existing colors and help complete the rhythmic movement across the canvas.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "Looking at the dynamic composition of intersecting wiggle lines, I notice an opportunity to add more visual interest to the upper section. To create a sense of continuity and resolve the upward movement, I'll extend a new wiggle line in Keppel from where the first teal line ended, moving further upward and slightly to the right. This will create a satisfying conclusion to the ascending motion while reinforcing the cool, calming presence of the Keppel color in the composition's upper register.",
