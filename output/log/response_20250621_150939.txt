I'll add an ethereal spray of particles that follows and enhances the rainbow arc, creating a sense of magical stardust trailing the colored spheres.

            "x": [50, 425, 800],

    ],
    "reasoning": "Delicate spray particles dance along rainbow trajectory, creating ethereal depth and mystery. Slow timing builds gossamer layers of astral energy."
