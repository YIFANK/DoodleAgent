Brush: marker
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 5
Thinking: To express happiness, I'll draw a cheerful sun in the top left corner using a bright yellow color. I will use the marker brush to create bold, bright strokes. The sun should have radiating lines to depict the warmth and joy associated with happiness, placed between coordinates (50, 0) to (120, 70) for the circle, and then radiating lines outward.

Brush: crayon
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To further express happiness, I'll add a few playful clouds to accompany the cheerful sun. Using a light blue color, I will use the crayon brush for a soft, fluffy texture. The clouds will be placed near the top left corner under the sun to give the sky a joyful and serene feel. I'll start with one cloud at coordinates (50, 80) to (150, 120).
