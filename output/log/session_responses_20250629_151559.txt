Question: Emotion drawing: AI-chosen mood
Canvas: output/20250629_151603/mood_step_24.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "The canvas shows a delicate, ethereal composition with interweaving curved lines creating a diagonal flow. I'll add another complementary wiggle stroke in Light Wisteria to enhance the airy, dreamlike quality. This new stroke will flow from the top left area, following the established diagonal movement but adding a subtle counterpoint to the existing pattern.",
  "brush": "wiggle",
  "color": "#D9AAF2",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600],
      "y": [100, 130, 160, 190, 220, 250, 280, 310, 340, 370],
      "t": [0, 1]
