Brush: marker
Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To complement the existing strokes, I'll add a horizontal line above the current shape to create a more structured look. I'll use the marker brush in the Sky Blue color. This placement provides balance and mirrors the horizontal flow of the existing strokes.

Brush: marker
Color: #FF7878
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To add more dynamic direction, I'll draw a diagonal line from the top of the current shape to the left. I'll use the marker brush in Light Red to provide contrast and energy. This will lead the eye through the composition.

Brush: crayon
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To enhance the composition, I'll add a curve below the existing shapes, creating a sense of closure. I'll use the crayon brush in Jasmine to introduce a warm tone that contrasts with the cooler colors. This will add depth and connection between different elements.

Brush: spray
Color: default
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To further enhance the design, I'll add some dots around the existing shapes using the spray brush. This will create an interesting texture and give a playful feel. I'll focus on placing them around the edges of the current elements to create a sense of movement.

Brush: marker
Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To give a sense of unity and vibrancy, I'll add a vertical line on the left side of the canvas using the marker brush in Wisteria. This addition will help frame the existing shapes and add a playful touch with its bright color.
