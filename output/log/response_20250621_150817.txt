Let me create a sweeping, ethereal composition to bring this blank canvas to life.

{
"brush": "rainbow",
"strokes": [
{
"x": [50, 200, 400, 650, 800],
"y": [450, 300, 200, 300, 450],
"t": [4, 3, 4, 3],
"description": "Prismatic wave"
}
],
"reasoning": "Creating undulating rainbow arc that flows across canvas, slow timing builds chromatic depth, wave form suggests harmony and movement, golden ratio guides peaks"
}
