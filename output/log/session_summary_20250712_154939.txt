Thinking: I'm looking at a blank white canvas, which offers endless possibilities. I'll start by creating a dynamic, sweeping gesture that will serve as the foundation for an abstract composition. I'll use the wiggle brush with a calming Keppel color to draw a flowing curved line that moves across the middle

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FF7878
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe a single wiggly teal line traversing the middle of the canvas. To create an interesting composition, I'll add a complementary wiggly line in a contrasting warm color (Light Red) slightly below the existing line. This will create a sense of movement and rhythm while maintaining balance. The

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe two parallel wavy lines - one in teal/keppel and one in light red, creating a rhythmic pattern. To build on this musical, wave-like composition, I'll add another complementary wave pattern above the existing ones using a contrasting warm color (jasmine) to create a harmonious tricolor arra

Thinking: I observe three wavy lines in different styles: a uniform yellow wave at the top, an intertwined teal and purple wave pattern in the middle, and a coral/light red wave at the bottom.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #5E1586
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe four parallel wavy lines spanning horizontally across the canvas in yellow, teal/purple, light red, and sky blue.

Thinking: I observe several parallel wavy lines in various colors creating a rhythmic pattern. To add visual interest and maintain the established rhythm while introducing variation, I'll add a more dynamic wiggly line in wisteria purple that weaves between the existing lines, starting from y-coordinate 290.
