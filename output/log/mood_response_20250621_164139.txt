  "reasoning": "The overlapping, semi-transparent circles created with the marker brush produce a gentle, flowing effect that embodies serenity. The slow drawing speeds (4-5) ensure smooth, deliberate strokes that enhance the peaceful atmosphere. The gradual blending of colors through overlapping creates a harmonious visual meditation, perfectly expressing a serene mood through soft, flowing forms."
