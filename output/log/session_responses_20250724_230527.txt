I'll begin with a gently rolling hill in a soft Keppel green color, using the marker brush to create a smooth, undulating line across the lower portion of the canvas. This will establish our ground and give us a foundation to build upon.",

Let's expand on the sky element by creating a larger cloud-like shape using the crayon brush with a light sky blue color.
