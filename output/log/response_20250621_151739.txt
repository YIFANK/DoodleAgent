I'll add a complementary element to transform this wavy line into a cheerful sunrise scene! Here's how we can enhance it:

{
  "brush": "rainbow",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [200, 425, 650],
      "y": [300, 380, 300],
      "t": [4, 4],
      "description": "Adding a colorful rainbow arc below the wavy line to create a sunrise/sunset scene"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "The existing orange wavy line looks like clouds, so adding a gentle rainbow arc below it will create a whimsical sky scene. Using the rainbow brush with slow speed will create a smooth, magical effect."
}
