Thinking: I want to add a series of gentle waves to evoke a serene ocean view. I'll use the wiggle brush with a sky blue color to create the impression of waves gently rolling across the canvas from left to right.

Thinking: Let's add some clouds in the sky to complement the ocean waves. I'll use the crayon brush with a light shade of sky blue to create fluffy cloud shapes near the top of the canvas.

Brush: marker
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To create a complete seaside scene, I'll add a sandy beach using the marker brush. I'll choose the jasmine color and draw a curved line at the bottom of the canvas to represent the shoreline, enhancing the scene's serene and relaxing feel.
