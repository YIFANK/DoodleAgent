      "t": [4, 4, 4],
      "description": "gentle wave pattern"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "The canvas is empty, so starting with a flowing wave pattern using Keppel marker creates a calming first element. The curved line moves gracefully from left to right with carefully planned coordinates to ensure smooth transitions."
