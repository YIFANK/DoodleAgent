Strokes: 3
Thinking: To express happiness, I'll create a dynamic, upward-sweeping composition using light and energetic colors. I'll start with a series of ascending curved lines in the center of the canvas that feel like they're dancing or floating upward, using the cheerful Jasmine yellow color. The curves will have a bouncy, spring-like quality that suggests joy and optimism.

Thinking: I notice three ascending wiggle strokes in a light yellow tone creating a joyful, bouncing movement from left to right.

I'll use a warmer Wisteria purple to create a pleasant color harmony with the existing yellow strokes.

The blue curves will follow the same dancing rhythm but positioned higher to complete the ascending celebratory feeling.
