Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 4
Thinking: I see a blank canvas, which gives me complete freedom to create something new. I'm feeling inspired to start with something whimsical and light - let's draw a cheerful sun in the upper portion of the canvas. I'll use the wiggle brush with a warm jasmine yellow to create a playful, energetic circular shape with radiating rays.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice a yellow wiggly oval shape in the upper portion of the canvas. To build on this, I'll use the wiggle brush to add a complementary inner shape in a calming blue color, creating a nested effect that adds depth while maintaining the playful wavy aesthetic.

------------------------------

Brush: wiggle
Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see two wavy lines on the canvas - one in yellow and one in light blue, connected together like a thought bubble or speech balloon. I'll add a complementary wavy line below in a soft purple tone to create a harmonious triple-wave pattern. This will add visual interest and balance to the composition.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FF7878
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a few wavy lines already on the canvas - a yellow wiggle line that curves into a blue one near the top, and a purple wiggle line in the middle. To add to this abstract composition, I'll draw another wiggly line in red below the existing ones to create a balanced vertical arrangement and add a warm accent color.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a pattern of wavy lines in different colors (yellow, blue, purple, and pink) arranged vertically on the canvas. To build on this abstract pattern, I'll add another wiggling line in green (Keppel) at the bottom to complete the composition. This will add a natural, organic element while maintaining the established rhythm.

Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice there are several wavy lines drawn with the wiggle brush in different colors. I see a yellow curved line at the top that connects to a blue line, a purple line in the middle, and a green-to-red gradient line at the bottom. To add to this playful composition, I'll create another wiggling line in Wisteria purple, placing it between the middle and bottom lines to maintain the visual rhythm and spacing.

Thinking: I see a playful abstract composition with wiggly lines and curves in pastel colors.
