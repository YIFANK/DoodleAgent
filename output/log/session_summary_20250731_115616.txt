Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To add a touch of warmth and balance the top-left area, I will draw a medium-sized circle using the crayon brush in Jasmine color. This will create a sunny, cheerful focal point that complements the existing colors. I'll place it slightly below and to the right of the cloud-like shape, creating harmony with the darker, structured elements.

Brush: fountain
Color: default
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To add a final touch of elegance, I'll draw a small arch using the fountain brush. This will create a delicate, graceful connection between the top and the middle portions of the design. I'll place it towards the top-center area, drawing it to curve slightly downward.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To introduce a vibrant feature, I'll draw a zigzag line using the wiggle brush in the Wisteria color. This will add dynamic energy and contrast against the existing elements, enhancing the playful nature of the composition. I'll position it towards the top-left area, connecting carefully with the floating cloud shape to create continuity.
