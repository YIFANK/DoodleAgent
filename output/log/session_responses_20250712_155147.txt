Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas, which gives us complete freedom to start our abstract composition. I'll begin with a bold, sweeping curved line in Wisteria purple that will create movement and serve as a foundation element. This curve will start in the upper left quadrant and sweep down towards the center right, creating a dynamic diagonal flow.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a gentle, wisteria-colored curve in the upper portion of the canvas. To create an interesting abstract composition, I'll add a complementary curve below it using Keppel to create a sense of balance and movement. This new curve will mirror the existing one but be slightly offset, creating a dynamic negative space between them.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe two gentle curves on the canvas - one in wisteria and one in a soft keppel tone. To build on this emerging wave-like pattern, I'll add a third curved line below, using a warm jasmine color to create a pleasing color progression from cool to warm tones. I'll position it slightly lower than the existing curves to maintain a balanced spacing and visual rhythm.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe three gentle curved lines on the canvas in wisteria, keppel, and jasmine colors. To create an interesting dynamic composition, I'll add a bolder, more angular line in Sky Blue that intersects diagonally across the existing curves. This will create visual tension and movement while maintaining the soft, ethereal quality of the piece. I'll position it to start from the upper right and sweep down toward the lower left.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe three gentle curved strokes in wisteria, keppel, and jasmine tones, connected by a playful blue wiggle line that creates dynamic movement. To add visual interest and balance, I'll add a vertical spray of dots that will intersect these curves near their right side, creating a sense of gravity and grounding the composition. The spray pattern will cascade from top to bottom, adding texture and depth.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a balanced composition with three horizontal curves in wisteria, keppel, and jasmine tones, connected by a playful wiggling blue line and anchored by a strong vertical spray column on the right. To add dynamic contrast and balance the composition, I'll create a gentle diagonal spray stroke that moves from the bottom left (around 200,450) up towards the middle (400,200), creating an opposing force to the existing diagonal wiggle line.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice a dynamic composition with three horizontal wavy lines in wisteria, keppel, and jasmine, connected by spray patterns and a blue wiggle line. To balance the right vertical spray column, I'll add a complementary vertical element on the left side using the fountain brush. This will create an elegant frame and add weight to the left portion of the composition, around coordinates (200,150) to (200,400).",
