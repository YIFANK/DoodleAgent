==================================================

[2025-07-23 17:04:36] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #387766
Strokes: 2
Thinking: To express disgust, I'll create an abstract squiggly form with harsh, irregular lines that convey repulsion and unease. I'll use a sickly green-teal color from the Keppel palette and the wiggle brush to create unsettling, writhing movements. The shape will be placed in the center of the canvas, looking like a disturbed, twisted form that seems to be recoiling.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:04:44] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #387766
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice there's a squiggly, unsettling form in Keppel green in the center. To amplify the feeling of disgust, I'll add another set of writhing, repulsive wiggles that seem to be pulling away from the original form. I'll place these slightly below and to the right of the existing shape, using the wiggle brush to create an organic, almost nauseous movement pattern. This will enhance the sense of revulsion and discomfort.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:04:51] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #387766
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the existing writhing forms in Keppel green, I want to enhance the feeling of disgust by adding another cluster of squirming, repulsive lines that appear to be recoiling away from the main mass. I'll place these new wiggles even further to the right and slightly lower, suggesting a spreading contamination or decay. The wiggle brush with the darker Keppel shade will create an especially unsettling effect, like something decomposing or festering.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:04:57] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #387766
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a series of sickly, writhing forms in Keppel green spreading across the canvas. To intensify the disgusted reaction, I'll add another set of squirming, twisted shapes that appear to be breaking apart and dispersing further right, like something decomposing or disintegrating. The wiggle brush with the darker Keppel shade will create unsettling, repulsive movements that seem to be fleeing from the main mass.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:05:03] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #387766
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the unsettling series of squirming forms spreading across the canvas, I'll add one final set of smaller, disintegrating wiggles even further to the right, suggesting the final decomposition of this repulsive form. The shapes will be smaller and more scattered, like the disgusting mass is breaking apart into its final putrid pieces. This will complete the rightward movement of decay and revulsion.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:05:10] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #387766
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the existing pattern of squirming, disgusted forms trailing across the canvas, I'll add one more cluster at the beginning of the sequence, making it appear even more repulsive and clustered. I'll place this new set of wiggles slightly to the left and above the first major cluster, using the darker Keppel shade to suggest something particularly nauseating and unpleasant. This will strengthen the starting point of our revolting composition.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:05:17] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #254F44
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe a series of writhing, sickly green forms spreading diagonally across the canvas, expressing disgust through their squirming, repulsive shapes. To intensify this feeling, I'll add another cluster at the leftmost part of the sequence, making it appear like the source of this revolting spread. I'll use the wiggle brush with the darkest Keppel shade to create particularly unsettling, twisted forms that seem to be the origin point of all this nastiness. This will anchor the entire composition and make it even more viscerally disgusting.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:05:23] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #254F44
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the writhing, sickly pattern that's formed - a series of nauseating green clusters moving diagonally across the canvas - I'll add one final repulsive cluster at the far left top of the sequence. This will complete the pattern of decomposition and disgust by showing where it all originated. Using the darkest Keppel shade with the wiggle brush, I'll create tighter, more concentrated squirms that suggest something particularly revolting at the source.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:05:29] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #254F44
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the existing sequence of sickly, writhing forms that trail diagonally across the canvas from top-left to bottom-right, I want to complete this nauseating composition by adding one more dense cluster at the uppermost left corner. This will create an even stronger sense of something repulsively oozing or decomposing as it moves across space. I'll use the wiggle brush with the darkest Keppel shade to make particularly tight, unsettling squiggles that feel like the concentrated source of all this revolting movement.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:05:36] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #254F44
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the diagonal trail of sickly, squirming forms across the canvas, I notice they create a repulsive movement from upper left to lower right. To heighten the feeling of disgust, I'll add another twisted, writhing cluster at the very start (leftmost) of the sequence. This new addition will be even smaller and more concentrated, like the first drops of something putrid that spawned this whole nauseating trail. Using the dark Keppel shade will emphasize the unsettling nature of these forms.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:05:42] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #254F44
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice the existing diagonal trail of sickly, squirming forms expressing disgust. To heighten this revulsion, I'll add a particularly repulsive cluster of tight, writhing wiggles at the rightmost bottom end of the sequence. This will show how the nauseating form has oozed and spread to its final state, using an even darker shade of Keppel to suggest something particularly putrid and decomposed. The placement will complete the diagonal movement and intensify the feeling of disgust.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:05:48] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #254F44
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe the diagonal pattern of writhing, sickly forms that express disgust through their squirming movements. To intensify this nauseating effect, I'll add another set of particularly repulsive wiggles that will bridge between two existing clusters in the middle section. This new addition will use the darkest Keppel shade (#254F44) to suggest something especially putrid and unsettling, creating a more dense and revolting central mass that seems to be actively decomposing.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:05:55] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #254F44
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the sequence of nauseating, writhing forms, I'll add another cluster of disgusting wiggles further along the diagonal path. I'll place these new squirming shapes to connect the rightmost elements, using the darkest Keppel shade to suggest something particularly repellent and decomposing. The placement at coordinates extending from (480,290) will maintain the diagonal flow while intensifying the revolting effect.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:06:01] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #254F44
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Observing the repulsive diagonal trail of writhing forms, I'll extend this nauseating pattern by adding another cluster of particularly revolting wiggles. I'll place them near coordinates (540,320), continuing the diagonal movement while making the shapes even more twisted and distorted. Using the darkest Keppel shade will enhance the unsettling, putrid quality of these forms, making them appear to be actively decomposing and spreading their revulsion across the canvas.

------------------------------

[2025-07-23 17:06:07] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #254F44
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the diagonal trail of sickly, writhing forms, I'll add a final cluster of particularly revolting wiggles at the furthest right point. These new squirming shapes will be even more scattered and decomposed, suggesting the final dissolution of this nauseating form. Using the darkest Keppel shade (#254F44) will emphasize how this repugnant mass finally breaks apart into putrid fragments. This placement at the end of the diagonal will complete our expression of utter disgust.
