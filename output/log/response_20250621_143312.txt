Let's start with something playful and organic on this blank canvas - I'm thinking a flowing, rainbow-colored wave pattern that sweeps across the space.

{
  "brush": "rainbow",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [50, 200, 400, 600, 800],
      "y": [250, 150, 300, 200, 350],
      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "flowing wave"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Creating a dynamic, colorful wave pattern to bring life and movement to the empty canvas"
}
