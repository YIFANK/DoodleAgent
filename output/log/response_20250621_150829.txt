I'll enhance this pastel rainbow arc with a complementary ethereal element that emphasizes its dreamy quality. Here's a composition that adds atmospheric depth while preserving the delicate nature of the original:

{
"brush": "spray",
"strokes": [
{
"x": [150, 300, 425, 550, 700],
"y": [450, 380, 350, 380, 450],
"t": [4, 4, 4, 4],
"description": "misty foundation"
}
],
"reasoning": "Ethereal spray arc mirrors rainbow's curve - soft opacity at t=4 creates dreamy atmosphere beneath primary colors. Gentle ascension adds depth."
}

This composition adds a subtle, misty foundation that:
- Mirrors the rainbow's graceful arc but with more diffusion
- Creates a sense of the rainbow emerging from atmospheric clouds
- Uses slow timing (t=4) to build up gentle, translucent layers
- Maintains focus on the original rainbow while adding dimensional depth
- Enhances the magical, dreamlike quality of the scene

The spray brush at low opacity will create a gentle, fog-like effect that appears to cradle and support the more defined rainbow circles above it.
