Question: Emotion drawing: pensive
Canvas: output/20250629_151237/mood_step_1.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "To express 'pensive', I'll create a minimalist composition using gentle curves and flowing lines that suggest contemplation and inner reflection. I'll start with a soft, meandering line in the upper portion of the canvas that drifts downward, like a slowly descending thought. Using the wisteria color palette will help convey the dreamy, contemplative mood.",
