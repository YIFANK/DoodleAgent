I'll enhance this artwork by adding a complementary spiral pattern using the rainbow brush to create a dynamic double-helix effect that mirrors the existing pastel circles.

  "brush": "rainbow",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 750],
      "y": [450, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 75],
      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "Rising spiral"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Creating mirror spiral using rainbow brush for dynamic flow, slow timing (t=4) for smooth transitions, positioned to complement existing arc of circles"
}

The rainbow brush will create a beautiful flowing complement to the existing pastel circles, while the carefully plotted coordinates create a rising spiral that mirrors but doesn't overlap the existing pattern. The slow timing values ensure smooth, fluid motion that enhances the gentle flow of the composition.
