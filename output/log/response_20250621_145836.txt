I'll add a flowing rainbow arc that complements the existing pastel bubble pattern, creating a harmonious connection between the circles.

{
  "brush": "rainbow",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [100, 250, 425, 600, 750],
      "y": [400, 300, 250, 300, 400],
      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "flowing rainbow arc"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Adding a smooth rainbow curve below the bubbles creates depth and ties the composition together"
}
