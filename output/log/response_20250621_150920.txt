I'll enhance this piece by adding an ethereal, dynamic element that complements the existing rainbow arc and scattered particles. Here's a design that uses the spray brush to create a flowing, cosmic feel:

{
"brush": "spray",
"strokes": [
{
"x": [150, 425, 700],
"y": [400, 300, 400],
"t": [4, 4],
"description": "cosmic wind flow"
}
],
"reasoning": "Adding ethereal spray creates depth beneath rainbow arc - slow timing (t=4) builds mysterious atmosphere while curved path suggests cosmic energy flow"
}

This stroke will create a gentle, nebulous curve below the existing rainbow arc, adding depth and movement to the composition. The spray brush with slow timing will create a misty, star-like quality that echoes the existing particle effect but with a softer, more atmospheric presence. The curved path complements the rainbow's arc while providing a subtle counterpoint that helps ground the piece visually.
