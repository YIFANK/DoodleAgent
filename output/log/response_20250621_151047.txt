I'll create a complementary spray pattern to enhance the cosmic, ethereal quality of this rainbow-hued celestial arc. Here's a design that will add depth and atmospheric texture:

{
"brush": "spray",
"strokes": [
{
"x": [100, 425, 750],
"y": [400, 200, 400],
"t": [4, 5],
"description": "stellar mist arc"
}
],
"reasoning": "Gossamer spray creates ethereal cosmic depth beneath chromatic spheres - slow timing (4,5) builds nebulous star-dust atmosphere, following golden arc"
}

This stroke will add a delicate layer of particle effects that enhances the existing celestial composition, creating a dreamy stellar mist that unifies the colorful spheres while adding visual depth and mystery to the space.
