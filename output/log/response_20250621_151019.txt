I'll create a complementary artistic element that enhances this cosmic rainbow arc using a spray technique to add ethereal stardust trails beneath the existing formation.

"reasoning": "Delicate spray creates celestial mist beneath rainbow arc - slow timing builds nebulous depth while following golden arc's curvature, grounding the composition"

This spray stroke will create a gentle, misty foundation that mirrors and supports the existing rainbow arc, adding depth and atmospheric dimension to the cosmic scene. The slow timing allows the particles to build gradually, creating a dreamy, ethereal quality that enhances the celestial nature of the composition.
