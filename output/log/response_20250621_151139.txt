Let me create a complementary element to enhance this cosmic, rainbow-like array of circular forms. I'll add some dynamic energy using the spray brush to create a swirling stellar dust effect.

    "brush": "spray",
    "strokes": [
        {
            "x": [100, 425, 750, 425, 100],
            "y": [400, 100, 400, 300, 400],

        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "Creating ethereal cosmic dance around existing circles - spray brush at slow timing builds delicate stellar dust atmosphere, reinforcing celestial energy"
}

I've designed this stroke to weave through and around the existing colorful circles, creating a unifying ethereal mist that enhances the cosmic, dreamy quality of the composition. The slow timing allows for gradual buildup of particle density, while the circular movement suggests galactic rotation and cosmic harmony.
