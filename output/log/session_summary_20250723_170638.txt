Brush: wiggle
Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 5
Thinking: I'll create an abstract, flowing dragon form using bold curved strokes. Starting with the body as a sinuous curve, then adding dynamic elements for the head, tail, and wings. Using Wisteria purple for a mystical feel, combined with Jasmine yellow for energy and drama.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see the beginning of an abstract dragon form in wisteria purple. To enhance this mystical creature, I'll add a dramatic sweep of warm yellow that will serve as fiery breath or energy emanating from the dragon's presence. I'll place this using the wiggle brush in a curving motion that starts from the upper left area of the existing form and sweeps outward, suggesting movement and vitality.

------------------------------

Brush: wiggle
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the existing dragon-like form in purple and yellow, I'll add another dynamic element to enhance the mystical creature's form. I'll create a sweeping tail movement using the wiggle brush in Keppel blue-green to add a cool, water-dragon element that contrasts with the existing warm and mystical tones. This will extend from the lower right area, creating a sense of fluid motion.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #E2BFF5
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice the elegant, flowing dragon form composed of wiggly lines in purple, yellow, and teal. To add more ethereal energy and movement, I'll create another flowing arc that suggests wings or mystical energy emanating from the dragon's central form. I'll use the wiggle brush with Light Wisteria (#E2BFF5) to create a gentle, floating curve that will complement the existing purple elements while adding lightness and elevation to the composition.

Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe an ethereal dragon form taking shape through wiggly lines in purple, yellow, and teal. To complete this mystical creature, I'll add another flowing element that suggests additional movement and energy. I'll use the wiggle brush with Wisteria purple to create a gentle curved line that will complement the existing form, adding more dynamic motion to the upper right quadrant, balancing the yellow breath element on the left.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFD1D1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice the ethereal dragon-like form emerging from wiggly lines in purple, yellow, and teal. To enhance the mystical feeling, I'll add another flowing element in Tea Rose red that suggests the dragon's internal energy or aura. I'll place this near the center of the form, creating a gentle curved line that weaves through the existing elements, adding warmth and vitality to the composition.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the ethereal dragon design that has emerged, I'll add another graceful element to enhance its mystical nature. I notice the flow from yellow breath through purple body to teal tail, and I'll add a complementary wiggle stroke in Keppel to suggest another tendril of mystical energy or perhaps a whisker-like element near the dragon's head area. This will balance the composition and add more dynamic movement in the upper left region.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the ethereal dragon composition that has developed with its flowing curves and energy tendrils, I'll add one final dynamic element to enhance its celestial nature. I'll place a graceful wiggle stroke in Keppel that suggests another flowing water-like energy tendril, extending from the lower right area. This will balance the composition and complement the existing teal elements while adding more fluid movement.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the ethereal dragon emerging from wiggly lines, I notice the composition could benefit from an additional mystical element. I'll add a gentle Wisteria purple curve in the upper region to suggest another ethereal wing or energy wave, which will help balance the overall flow and add to the dragon's otherworldly presence. This new element will complement the existing curves while maintaining the delicate, floating quality of the piece.

Thinking: Looking at the ethereal dragon composition, I notice an opportunity to add more mystical energy to its core. I'll create a gentle wiggling line in Sky Blue that will weave through the central area, suggesting a rippling water or air current that flows through the dragon's form. This will add a new dimension of movement while complementing the existing purple, yellow, and teal elements.

Thinking: I observe the mystical dragon form composed of flowing wiggly lines in various colors. To enhance the ethereal quality, I'll add another flowing element using Sky Blue in the upper region. This will suggest another wave of celestial energy or perhaps a cloud-like element that the dragon is emerging from, adding depth and atmosphere to the composition. The placement will complement the existing curves while maintaining the piece's dreamlike quality.

Thinking: Observing the ethereal dragon that has emerged through multiple flowing wiggly lines, I notice an opportunity to enhance the mystical energy around its core. I'll add a flowing element in Jasmine yellow that will curve gently through the central region, suggesting another wave of magical energy or perhaps a glowing aura that emanates from the dragon's essence. This will complement the existing purple, blue, and teal elements while adding a warm, luminous quality to the composition.
