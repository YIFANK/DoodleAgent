Brush: wiggle
Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice a small mint-colored stroke in the middle-right area of the canvas. I'll create an abstract fish design using flowing curves, starting with the body shape. I'll use the Keppel palette for the water-like atmosphere and Sky Blue for the fish form, placing it to create a sense of movement from left to right.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #288AAB
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a light wavy blue line at the top and a mint-colored shape below. To expand this into an abstract river scene, I'll add a flowing wave pattern using the wiggle brush in a deeper sky blue tone. This will create a sense of water movement and complement the existing elements. I'll position it to suggest flowing water currents below the existing wavy line.

Thinking: I see the wavy blue lines suggesting water movement and a mint-colored shape. I'll add a more defined fish form using the wisteria color to create contrast against the blue waves. I'll place it swimming between the existing wave patterns, with a graceful curve to suggest natural movement.

Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe a composition with wavy blue lines suggesting water movement, a mint green shape, and a purple form. To enhance this aquatic scene, I'll add another fish-like form using the Jasmine color palette to create a warm, contrasting element. I'll position it slightly below and to the left of the existing elements to create a sense of depth and movement in the river scene.

Thinking: Looking at the canvas, I see wavy blue lines, a purple shape, a mint green element, and a yellow form creating an abstract aquatic scene. To enhance this river composition, I'll add another flowing fish form using the Sky Blue palette, positioning it in an open space near the center. This will add balance and create a sense of swimming movement through the abstract water currents.

Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice several wavy lines and abstract fish-like forms in purples, blues, and yellows creating a fluid river scene.
