    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Adding a soft, swooping bird shape in tea rose pink to complement the existing clouds and create movement in the upper portion of the scene. The gentle arc matches the existing curves while adding a new organic element to the pastoral composition."

Question: What interesting detail could you add?

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "brush": "wiggle",
  "color": "#6BB9A4",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [200, 220, 240, 260, 280, 300],
      "y": [400, 390, 395, 385, 395, 390],
      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "Gentle wiggly grass detail on left side"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Adding balancing grass detail to the left side of the composition using the Keppel green wiggle brush. This helps create visual symmetry with the existing grass on the right and extends the natural landscape elements across the canvas width."

Question: How would you continue this artistic expression?
Canvas: output/canvas_step_29.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "brush": "wiggle",
  "color": "#6BB9A4",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350],
      "y": [410, 400, 415, 405, 420, 410],
      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "Gentle wavy grass line on bottom left"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Adding more organic grass texture to balance the left side of the landscape, using the same Keppel green and wiggle brush to maintain consistency with existing grass elements. The slow timing creates natural, flowing waves."
