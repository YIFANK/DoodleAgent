I'll draw a small pool of tears gathering at the bottom of the canvas, beneath some of the falling teardrops. Using the Sky Blue in a lighter shade will suggest these are tears that have fallen and collected, symbolizing how sadness can accumulate over time. The gentle, curved shape will mirror the drooping forms above it.",
