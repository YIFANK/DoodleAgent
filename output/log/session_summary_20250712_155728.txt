Brush: wiggle
Color: #FF7878
Strokes: 4
Thinking: Mood: excited - To express excitement, I'll create an energetic burst pattern radiating from the center of the canvas. I'll use vibrant colors and dynamic upward strokes that suggest movement and joy, like fireworks or a celebratory explosion of energy. Starting from the middle, I'll draw multiple wiggling lines bursting outward in different directions.

This will create a focal point and add a sense of movement and joy radiating from the center. I'll place these decorative elements carefully to maintain balance while enhancing the dynamic quality of the existing composition.
