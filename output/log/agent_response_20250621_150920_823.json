    "content": "I'll enhance this piece by adding an ethereal, dynamic element that complements the existing rainbow arc and scattered particles. Here's a design that uses the spray brush to create a flowing, cosmic feel:\n\n{\n\"brush\": \"spray\",\n\"strokes\": [\n{\n\"x\": [150, 425, 700],\n\"y\": [400, 300, 400],\n\"t\": [4, 4],\n\"description\": \"cosmic wind flow\"\n}\n],\n\"reasoning\": \"Adding ethereal spray creates depth beneath rainbow arc - slow timing (t=4) builds mysterious atmosphere while curved path suggests cosmic energy flow\"\n}\n\nThis stroke will create a gentle, nebulous curve below the existing rainbow arc, adding depth and movement to the composition. The spray brush with slow timing will create a misty, star-like quality that echoes the existing particle effect but with a softer, more atmospheric presence. The curved path complements the rainbow's arc while providing a subtle counterpoint that helps ground the piece visually.",
