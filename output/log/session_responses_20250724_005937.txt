Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank canvas, which gives me complete freedom to create! I'm feeling inspired to start with something organic and flowing. Let's begin with a gentle wave-like pattern in the lower portion of the canvas using the wiggle brush. I'll use a calming Sky Blue color to create a base that could evolve into an ocean scene or abstract landscape.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice a light blue wiggling wave pattern at the bottom of the canvas. To build upon this aquatic theme, I'll add another wave layer above the existing one, but with a slightly different rhythm and amplitude. This will create a sense of depth and movement, suggesting rippling water. I'll use a darker shade of Sky Blue to create contrast with the first wave.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "Looking at the canvas, there's a beautiful wave pattern emerging with light blue wiggling lines and a small darker accent above. To enhance this aquatic scene, I'll add some playful seaweed-like elements rising up from the wave pattern. I'll use the Keppel color family to suggest underwater vegetation, placing these vertical wiggly strokes at strategic points along the wave pattern. The deep teal color will complement the existing sky blue waves nicely.",

Raw Response:
{
    "thinking": "The underwater scene is taking shape beautifully with the wave patterns and seaweed elements. To complete this oceanic composition, I'd like to add one more small piece of floating seaweed in a darker shade of blue, positioned near the center-right area. This will add depth and help balance the composition by creating a sense of movement and rhythm that complements the existing elements.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "The underwater scene has developed nicely with waves and tall seaweed strands, but I notice a small gap in the rhythm around the second seaweed strand. To maintain the balanced flow of the composition, I'll add a small piece of floating seaweed in a deeper Sky Blue color. This will help create a more dynamic sense of movement and fill the negative space without overcrowding the composition.",

  "thinking": "The underwater scene has a lovely rhythm with its waves and vertical seaweed elements. To add more depth and movement, I'll draw another small piece of seaweed near the center-left area using the wiggle brush. I'll use a deeper Keppel tone to suggest this piece is slightly further in the background, helping to create more layers of depth in our underwater garden.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "Looking at the underwater scene, I notice we have a beautiful rhythm of waves and seaweed, but there could be more interesting movement in the upper portions. I'll add some small floating bubbles or plankton using the wiggle brush with a light Sky Blue color (#B2DEED). These will be placed in the spaces between the seaweed strands, floating upward in gentle spiral patterns to suggest water currents and add more life to the scene.",
