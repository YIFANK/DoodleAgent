Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas, which offers endless possibilities. I'll start by creating a dynamic flowing form in the center using the wiggle brush. I want to create an organic, wave-like movement that will serve as a focal point and foundation for the composition. I'll use Sky Blue to suggest a fluid, aqueous feeling.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice a very minimal mark near the center of the otherwise blank canvas. To begin creating an abstract composition, I'll start with a bold, sweeping curved line using the marker brush in a deep wisteria purple. This will create a strong foundational element that can anchor future marks. I'll place it in the upper third of the canvas, creating a dynamic curved movement from left to right.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a light wisteria-colored circle in the upper left area and a wiggly sky blue line creating a wave-like pattern in the center. To create an interesting composition, I'll add a bold jasmine-colored stroke that echoes the wave pattern but sits lower on the canvas, creating a sense of depth and movement. This will create a pleasing visual triangle with the existing elements.",
