Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas - a perfect opportunity to start with a bold, dynamic element. I'll create a sweeping curve using the wiggle brush in a calming Keppel blue-green that will flow from the upper left quadrant down towards the center. This will establish an organic, flowing movement that can anchor future elements.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a single wavy teal line in the upper portion of the canvas, created with the wiggle brush. To create an interesting abstract composition, I'll add a complementary curved line below it using a different color from our palette. I'll use the wisteria purple to create a beautiful contrast with the existing teal line. This new line will mirror the organic, flowing nature of the first line but with its own unique rhythm.",

Raw Response:

To create a balanced composition, I'll add a third complementary wiggle line in a warm jasmine yellow color that will connect with these existing elements. I'll place it in the lower left quadrant, creating a dynamic diagonal movement across the canvas that complements the existing lines while adding a new color element.",

Raw Response:

To create an interesting counterbalance, I'll add a new wiggle line in Sky Blue that starts from the bottom right and moves upward with a gentle curve.
