I'll add a complementary layer of dynamic motion using the spray brush to create a sweeping undercurrent beneath the rainbow arc, adding depth and energetic flow to the composition.

{
    "brush": "spray",
    "strokes": [
        {
            "x": [100, 425, 750],
            "y": [400, 300, 400],
            "t": [4, 4],
            "description": "cosmic undertow"
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gentle spray arc creates atmospheric depth below rainbow, slow timing (t=4) builds ethereal mist effect while black particles dance with existing elements"
}

This addition will create a subtle but important layer of depth, with the spray particles interacting with the existing dotted elements while providing a unifying base movement that enhances the overall cosmic feel of the piece. The slow timing allows the particles to emerge gradually, creating a more organic and atmospheric effect.
