I'll begin with the stem, slightly bent to show it's losing strength, using a dark green marker to convey the somber mood. The stem will start higher on the canvas and curve downward, showing the weight of sadness.",

To enhance the feeling of sadness, I'll add some fallen petals scattered beneath it, using the light blue color to represent tears or forgotten hopes.

I'll draw some drooping, wilted leaves attached to the stem using a darker shade of Keppel to emphasize the plant's declining state.

I'll use the marker brush with the darkest Wisteria shade to create small, heavy teardrops falling from the purple bud itself. These will be more substantial than the wiggly tears, representing heavier, more profound drops of sadness coming directly from the flower's heart.
