Thinking: The canvas is currently blank. Let's create a simple doodle of a sun in the top-left corner to bring some brightness to the canvas.

Brush: crayon
Color: #99D3E7
Strokes: 1
Thinking: The canvas features a sun in the top-left corner. To complement it, I'll draw a small cloud nearby using the crayon brush. This will add depth and contribute to a sunshine-and-clouds scene.
