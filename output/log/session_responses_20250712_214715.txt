Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas full of potential. Let's begin with an organic, flowing composition. I'll start with a bold wisteria-colored curve in the upper left quadrant to establish a dynamic focal point and create movement. This will set up an interesting foundation for additional elements to respond to.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice a gentle purple wiggle line in the upper portion of the canvas. To create an interesting abstract composition, I'll add a complementary curved element below it, using a warm jasmine yellow color. This will create a nice visual balance and contrast with the cool purple tone. I'll position it lower and slightly to the right to create dynamic tension.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe two wiggly lines on the canvas - one in purple towards the top-left and another in yellow in the center-right. To create a balanced composition, I'll add a third wiggly line in a complementary position in the lower right portion of the canvas. This will create a dynamic diagonal flow across the composition while maintaining visual harmony. I'll use a cool Keppel color to contrast with the existing warm and purple tones.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe three wiggly lines arranged in a diagonal descending pattern from top-left to bottom-right, in purple, yellow, and teal colors. To create balance and visual interest, I'll add a red wiggly line that ascends diagonally in the opposite direction, intersecting with the existing pattern. This will create a dynamic tension and help establish a more complex compositional rhythm. I'll position it in the lower left area, moving upward towards the center.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe four wiggly lines creating a gentle rhythm across the canvas - in purple, yellow, red, and teal. To continue this lyrical composition, I'll add another wiggle line in Sky Blue that will dance between the existing lines, creating a harmonic interplay. I'll position it in the middle-right area, following the established diagonal flow but with a slight counter-movement to create visual tension.",

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I observe several wiggly lines creating a gentle diagonal rhythm across the canvas in purple, yellow, red, blue and green tones. To continue this dynamic flow, I'll add another wiggle line at the bottom-right section of the canvas.

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I observe several wiggly lines creating a gentle descending rhythm across the canvas in various colors. To add visual interest and balance, I'll create a new wiggle line in the lower left area that mirrors the descending pattern.

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I observe a delicate composition of wiggly lines in various colors creating a musical, flowing pattern across the canvas. To enhance this rhythm, I'll add another wiggly line in the upper right quadrant (around coordinates 700,200) using Tea Rose Red. This will help balance the composition and create a pleasing diagonal flow with the existing lines while leaving enough negative space to maintain the airy, light feeling of the piece.",

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I observe a delicate composition of wiggly lines creating a musical, wave-like pattern across the canvas. To enhance this rhythmic feel, I'll add another wiggly line in the upper right quadrant, using a light teal color from the Keppel palette. This will help balance the composition and create a dialogue with the existing lines, particularly complementing the purple wave in the upper left. The new line will have a gentle ascending curve to contrast with some of the descending elements.",

To complement this composition, I'll add a new wiggle stroke in the bottom-center area, using the Keppel green color family. This will help balance the composition and create a sense of movement that echoes the existing strokes while filling an empty space. The new stroke will be slightly longer and placed at a gentle upward angle.",
