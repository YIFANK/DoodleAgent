Brush: marker
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a blank canvas, and I feel inspired to create a cheerful landscape. I'll start by drawing a bright sun in the upper portion of the canvas using the marker tool with a warm Jasmine yellow color. The sun will be positioned slightly off-center to create visual interest.

Brush: crayon
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice a faint yellow curved line in the upper portion of the canvas, suggesting the beginning of what could be a simple smile or rainbow shape. I'll add a complementary curved line below it to create a more complete circular or smile-like shape, using a soft Keppel color to create a gentle, calming contrast with the existing yellow element.

Brush: spray
Color: default
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a simple scene with two curved lines - one in a light yellow tone at the top and a mint green curved line below it. It appears to be the beginnings of a sad face expression. To complete this expressive drawing, I'll add a matching curved line on the left side of the bottom curve using the same spray brush and keppel color to create balance and finish the mouth shape.

Brush: spray
Color: default
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a composition starting to take shape with a yellow arc at the top, a teal curved line in the middle, and a spray of dots at the bottom. To add more emotion and complete the suggested face-like expression, I'll draw another teal curved line that mirrors the existing one, creating a symmetrical mouth-like shape.

Thinking: I see a composition developing with a yellow arc at the top (like a sun), a teal/green curved line in the middle, and some spray-painted black shapes at the bottom that look like rolling hills or clouds. To build on this dreamy landscape, I'll add another curved element in a complementary purple color to create visual interest and balance in the middle section, placing it near but not overlapping the existing teal curve.
