Question: What would you like to draw next?

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "Looking at our serene wave pattern composition, I notice we could strengthen the central focal point. I'll add a wave sequence with a slightly deeper sky blue tone that will create a gentle anchor in the middle of the canvas. This will help draw the eye inward and add a subtle layer of depth to our ethereal seascape, while maintaining the delicate balance we've established with the surrounding lighter waves.",
