Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas, which offers unlimited potential for creative expression. I'll start with a bold, sweeping gesture using the wiggle brush in a calming Keppel color to create an organic, flowing form that will serve as a foundation for the composition. I'll place this in the lower third of the canvas to create visual weight and ground the piece.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a single wiggly teal line running horizontally across the bottom third of the canvas. To create visual interest and balance, I'll add another wiggle line above it that mirrors its wave pattern but with a contrasting color. This will create a sense of rhythm and movement across the canvas. I'll use the Wisteria color to create a beautiful contrast with the existing teal line.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice two parallel wavy lines - one in wisteria purple and one in keppel green - creating a gentle undulating pattern. To build on this rhythm, I'll add a third complementary line above using a warm jasmine yellow. This will create a pleasing visual trinity while maintaining the established wavelength pattern but shifting slightly in phase to create interesting negative spaces between the lines.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe three parallel wavy lines in yellow, purple, and teal creating a harmonious wavelike pattern. To build on this rhythmic composition, I'll add a fourth wave line below the existing ones, using a warm Light Red color to create temperature contrast with the cool tones above. This will extend the visual movement and add depth to the composition. The new line will maintain similar wave amplitude and frequency but be slightly offset to create interesting negative spaces.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see four parallel wavy lines in yellow, purple, teal, and coral creating a harmonious wave pattern. To complete this rhythmic composition, I'll add one final light sky blue wiggle line above the yellow one, maintaining the same wavelength but slightly offset. This will create a complete set of five undulating lines that dance across the canvas in a pleasing color progression.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice a beautiful rhythm of parallel wavy lines in sky blue, jasmine yellow, wisteria purple, keppel green, and light red. To complete this harmonious composition, I'll add one final wiggle line in Sky Blue at the very bottom of the canvas. This will create a satisfying bookend effect since we have sky blue at the top, and it will maintain the established wavelength and amplitude pattern while adding another layer to our abstract wave symphony.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a beautiful pattern of parallel wavy lines in various colors, creating a harmonious rhythm across the canvas. To complement this existing composition, I'll add another wavy line in the middle section where there appears to be more space, using Light Red to add warmth and create balance with the cooler tones. This will help maintain the visual rhythm while adding a new color dimension to the piece.",
