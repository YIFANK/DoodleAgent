Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I'm feeling joyful and want to start drawing something cheerful! Let's begin with a big sunny smile in the center of the canvas. I'll use the wiggle brush with a warm yellow color to create a happy curved line that will form the base of a simple smiley face. The wavy nature of the wiggle brush adds a playful, energetic feeling that matches my happy mood.

Brush: marker
Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 2
Thinking: The canvas has a cheerful yellow wiggling smile! To make this even happier, I want to add bright, joyful eyes above the smile. I'll use the marker brush with a vibrant sky blue color to create two playful oval shapes. The bright blue will contrast beautifully with the yellow smile, and rounded shapes naturally convey happiness. I'll place them symmetrically above the smile curve, with the left eye around coordinates (350,250) and the right eye around (450,250).

Color: #FFD1D1
Strokes: 4
Thinking: The canvas has a sweet smiley face with bright blue eyes and a yellow wiggly smile! To amplify the joyful feeling, I want to add some playful, bouncy dots around the face like little bubbles of happiness. I'll use the crayon brush with a soft tea rose color to create gentle, textured circles floating around the smiley face. This will add a sense of lightness and celebration to the drawing, expressing how happiness bubbles up and spreads outward!

Thinking: Looking at our cheerful smiley face with its bright blue eyes, yellow smile, and soft pink bubbles floating around, I feel inspired to add more joyful energy! Let's create some radiating happiness by adding playful wavy lines bursting outward from behind the head, like rays of sunshine or waves of positive energy. I'll use the wiggle brush with a warm jasmine yellow to create these energetic lines that will emphasize the happy, glowing feeling of the whole drawing.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: The happy face is really coming together with its bright blue eyes, yellow wiggly smile, pink bubbles, and radiating energy lines! To complete this joyful expression, I want to add one more cheerful wavy line at the bottom of the face, like a bouncy little decorative element that adds to the whimsical nature of the drawing. I'll use the wiggle brush with the same warm jasmine yellow to create a playful curvy line below the smile, making the whole face feel like it's floating with happiness.

Thinking: The canvas shows such a delightful smiley face with radiating happiness! To add even more joy, I want to place a floating crown-like decoration above the face made of interconnected hearts.

I'll use the wiggle brush with a soft wisteria purple to create this playful element, adding a new color that complements our existing palette while maintaining the whimsical mood.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at this delightful smiley face with all its cheerful elements, I want to add another curvy smile underneath the main one, like a double-happy expression! Since happiness often comes in waves, I'll use the wiggle brush with our warm jasmine yellow to create another gentle curve below the existing smile, but slightly longer to give a sense of the happiness expanding. This will make the face look extra joyful, as if it can barely contain its happiness!

I'll place these wiggly lines slightly higher than our existing ones, creating a sense of joy bubbling upward and outward. This will add to the playful, energetic feeling of the whole drawing, making it seem like happiness is just overflowing!

Thinking: Looking at our delightful smiley face with all its cheerful elements, I want to add one more playful detail at the very bottom of the canvas - a wiggly foundation that grounds all this floating happiness!

This will be like a happy little horizon line that the whole face seems to float above, completing our joyful composition with a flourishing finish!

Since happiness is contagious and spreads everywhere, let's add an extra-long wiggly line at the very bottom of our canvas, like a happy foundation that anchors all the joy above it. This will be the longest wave yet, stretching almost across the entire canvas, symbolizing how happiness knows no bounds!

Thinking: I'm feeling joyful and want to start creating a cheerful sun in the upper right corner of the canvas! The sun radiates happiness and positive energy.
