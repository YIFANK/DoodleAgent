  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas, which offers endless possibilities. Let's start with something bold and dynamic - I'll create a sweeping diagonal line using the wiggle brush in a vibrant Keppel color. This will serve as an energetic foundation element, cutting across the canvas from upper left to lower right, creating movement and visual interest.",

To create an interesting dynamic composition, I'll add a contrasting wiggly line in wisteria purple that mirrors this line but curves in the opposite direction, creating a gentle X-pattern.
