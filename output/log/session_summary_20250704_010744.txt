Thinking: I see a blank white canvas that offers infinite possibilities. I'll start by creating an organic, flowing composition using the wiggle brush in a calming Keppel color.

Thinking: I observe a nearly blank canvas with just a tiny mark near the top. Let's create an abstract foundation using the Jasmine color to bring warmth and energy.
