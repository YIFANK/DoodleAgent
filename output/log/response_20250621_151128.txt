I'll create a complementary artistic expression that builds on this beautiful rainbow arc composition with its ethereal spray texture and orbiting dark elements. Here's a design that will enhance the cosmic, celestial quality:

{
"brush": "spray",
"strokes": [
{
"x": [100, 425, 750],
"y": [450, 380, 450],
"t": [4, 5],
"description": "Stardust bridge"
}
],
"reasoning": "Creating ethereal mirrored arc below existing rainbow - spray brush at t=4,5 builds delicate cosmic depth while dark speckles dance across space"
}

This composition adds a gentle, mirrored arc that creates a sense of cosmic symmetry with the existing colorful spheres. The slow timing (4,5) allows the spray particles to build gradually, echoing the delicate texture of the original piece. The arc placement creates a subtle gravitational pull, transforming the entire composition into a celestial dance of color and void.
