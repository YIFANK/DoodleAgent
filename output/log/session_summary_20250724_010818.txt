Brush: marker
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a blank canvas, which gives us complete freedom to create! Let's start with something playful and organic - I'm thinking of drawing a whimsical flower shape. I'll begin with a central circle in a warm jasmine yellow, positioning it slightly above center to leave room for a stem and leaves.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFED95
Strokes: 6
Thinking: I see a soft yellow circular shape in the upper portion of the canvas. To develop this into a flower, let's add some delicate petals around it using the wiggle brush in a light yellow tone. I'll create loose, wavy petals radiating outward from the center at roughly 425,220. This will give our flower a more natural, organic feel while maintaining the whimsical quality.

Thinking: The canvas now shows a whimsical yellow flower with wiggly petals radiating outward. To complete this cheerful scene, let's add a gentle stem using the marker brush in a fresh Keppel green color. I'll position it below the flower's center, creating a slightly curved line to suggest natural movement and growth.

Thinking: I see a delightful flower with wiggly yellow petals and a mint green stem. To add more whimsy and natural movement, I'll add some curly grass blades near the base of the flower using the wiggle brush in a lighter Keppel shade. This will create a sense of the flower growing from a playful garden patch. I'll position these curls near the bottom of the stem, around coordinates 415,400.

Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a charming flower with wispy yellow petals, a mint green stem, and a small curly detail at the base. To enhance the playful, natural feel, I'll add another small wiggly grass blade on the opposite side of the stem. This will create balance and suggest a small patch of whimsical grass. I'll position this new curl to mirror the existing one, starting from near the stem's base.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: The canvas shows a delightful flower with wiggly yellow petals radiating from a central point, supported by a mint green stem with playful curls at its base. To add more whimsy and character, I'll create some gentle steam-like wisps rising from the flower using the wiggle brush in a soft jasmine yellow. These will suggest a magical, fragrant essence rising from our cheerful bloom, positioned above and around the flower's center.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at this whimsical flower, I notice we could add some additional magical wisps on the other side to balance the composition. I'll use the wiggle brush with the same jasmine yellow to create flowing, ethereal lines that mirror the existing wisps on the left side. This will create a sense of symmetry and enhance the magical, dreamy quality of our flower.
