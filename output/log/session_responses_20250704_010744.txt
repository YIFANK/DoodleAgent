Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas that offers infinite possibilities. I'll start by creating an organic, flowing composition using the wiggle brush in a calming Keppel color. I want to create a sweeping movement across the canvas that will serve as a foundation for additional elements. The stroke will begin in the upper left quadrant and flow diagonally downward with gentle undulations.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a nearly blank canvas with just a tiny mark near the top. Let's create an abstract foundation using the Jasmine color to bring warmth and energy. I'll draw a series of dynamic curved lines that will sweep across the upper portion of the canvas, creating a sense of movement and establishing a strong compositional element that can be built upon later.",

Canvas: output/20250704_010748/canvas_step_2.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a whimsical teal wiggle line in the upper portion of the canvas. To create visual balance and develop an engaging abstract composition, I'll add a complementary curved element below it, using a warmer color from our palette. I'll use the Jasmine color to create a dynamic contrast with the existing teal line, positioning it slightly lower and offset to create an interesting negative space between the elements.",

Canvas: output/20250704_010748/canvas_step_3.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe an interesting wavy pattern made of alternating teal (Keppel) and yellow (Jasmine) wiggle strokes that creates a gentle, flowing movement across the canvas. To add more dynamic energy and balance to the composition, I'll create a complementary curved line that starts from the bottom left and sweeps upward, using the Light Red palette to introduce a new color that will create visual interest and contrast with the existing elements.",

Canvas: output/20250704_010748/canvas_step_4.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe two wavy lines on the canvas - one in teal and yellow creating an alternating pattern near the top, and another yellow wiggle below it. To build on this rhythmic composition, I'll add another complementary wiggle line in Keppel that mirrors the bottom yellow line but slightly offset, creating a sense of movement and dialogue between the lines. This will maintain the established visual language while adding depth to the composition.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a delicate composition of wiggling lines in Keppel, Jasmine, and Tea Rose colors creating an organic, flowing pattern. To enhance this rhythm, I'll add a complementary wiggle line in Sky Blue that weaves through the negative space in the upper right quadrant. This will add a new color dimension while maintaining the established flowing aesthetic.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe several wavy lines creating a delicate pattern across the canvas in teal, yellow, and coral colors. To add visual interest and balance, I'll introduce a new wiggling line in wisteria purple that will dance between the existing lines, starting from the middle-right and moving upward. This will add a new color dimension while maintaining the flowing aesthetic.",
