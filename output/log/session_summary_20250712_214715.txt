Thinking: I notice a gentle purple wiggle line in the upper portion of the canvas. To create an interesting abstract composition, I'll add a complementary curved element below it, using a warm jasmine yellow color.

Thinking: I observe four wiggly lines creating a gentle rhythm across the canvas - in purple, yellow, red, and teal.
