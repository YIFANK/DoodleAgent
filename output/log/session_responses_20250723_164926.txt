    "thinking": "Looking at the blank canvas, I want to create a cheerful, bouncy design that expresses happiness. I'll start with a series of connected bouncing curves using the wiggle brush in a bright, joyful jasmine yellow color. These curves will create a dynamic, wave-like pattern that suggests movement and playfulness, starting from the left side of the canvas and bouncing across towards the right, like a happy skipping motion.",

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I see a playful yellow wiggling line in the lower left portion of the canvas. To build on this happy emotion, I'll create a whimsical flower using the marker brush with a cheerful wisteria purple color. I'll place it near the start of the wiggle line around (150, 250) to create a focal point. The flower will have simple curved petals radiating outward, suggesting joy and blooming happiness.",

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "Looking at the canvas, I see a playful yellow wiggle line and a purple flower shape. To enhance the happy mood, I'll add a whimsical smile that appears to be floating in space using the jasmine yellow color again. I'll place it in the upper portion of the canvas, like a cheerful crescent moon with a gentle curve and a simple expressive line for the smile. This will create a sense of joy and lightness, complementing the existing elements while adding a new focal point.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a whimsical composition with yellow curves suggesting a smile and a purple flower element. To enhance the happy emotion, I'll add a large, gentle circular arc in the top portion using the wiggle brush in jasmine yellow, like a big warm sun or joyful embrace surrounding the existing elements. This will create a protective, nurturing feeling while maintaining the light, cheerful mood of the piece. The arc will sweep from around (100,100) through the top of the canvas and back down to (700,100), creating a large semi-circular shape that frames the existing elements.",

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I notice the canvas has a delightful composition with yellow wiggly curves forming a large embracing arc, a smile-like shape, and some base curves, along with a purple flower accent. To amplify the happy emotion, I want to add some playful swirling energy around the purple flower area using the wiggle brush in bright jasmine yellow. These swirls will create a sense of joyful movement and energy radiating from the flower, like happiness spinning outward. I'll place these swirls starting near (150,250) and spiral outward in a celebratory pattern.",

  "thinking": "I see a delightful composition with swirling yellow curves and a purple flower element creating a joyful atmosphere. To enhance this happy feeling, I'll add some bouncing, floating circular shapes using the wiggle brush in wisteria purple to complement the existing yellow swirls. These playful dots will dance around the upper right space of the canvas (around 400-600 x 100-300 area) where there's currently less detail, creating a sense of bubbling joy and lightness floating upward. This will balance the composition while maintaining its whimsical nature.",
