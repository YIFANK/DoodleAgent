Brush: wiggle
Color: #387766
Strokes: 5
Thinking: Mood: melancholic - To express melancholy, I'll create a solitary tree with drooping branches using the wiggle brush, positioned off-center to enhance the feeling of isolation. The color palette will use darker tones of Keppel to create a somber mood. The tree will have a slight lean to suggest a weighted, heavy feeling that often accompanies melancholy.
