Brush: wiggle
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe a blank canvas that offers infinite possibilities. I'll start by creating a bold, dynamic composition using the wiggle brush to establish an energetic foundation. I'll place a series of wavy lines in the Keppel color family that will sweep across the canvas diagonally, creating a sense of movement and depth.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #387766
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe a single teal wiggling line moving diagonally upward across the canvas. To create an interesting counterpoint, I'll add a parallel wiggle line slightly below the first one, using a darker shade of Keppel to create depth and visual interest. This will establish a rhythmic dialogue with the existing line while maintaining harmony in the composition.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #88C7B6
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see two parallel wiggling lines in shades of Keppel creating a diagonal upward movement. To complete this rhythmic composition, I'll add a third wiggling line in a lighter shade of Keppel (#88C7B6) that will dance above the existing lines, creating a sense of ascension and lightness. This will create a harmonious trio of lines that suggest waves or musical notation.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #C3E3DB
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe three wavy lines in various shades of Keppel creating an ascending diagonal movement. To complete this organic composition, I'll add another wiggle line in the lightest Keppel shade (#C3E3DB) above the others, furthering the sense of upward movement and lightness. This will create a quaternary rhythm that suggests natural phenomena like wind patterns or ocean waves.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #E1F1ED
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe a series of wavy, parallel lines in various shades of Keppel creating an ascending diagonal pattern. To complete this rhythmic composition, I'll add one final wiggle line using the very lightest shade of Keppel (#E1F1ED) positioned above all others. This will create a crescendo effect in both position and color, making the composition feel like it's dissolving into the white space of the canvas.

------------------------------

Brush: wiggle
Color: #CCE9F3
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe an elegant series of wavy lines in varying shades of Keppel creating a diagonal ascension pattern. To provide a sense of completion and visual balance, I'll add one more wiggle line at the top of the composition using Sky Blue (#CCE9F3). This will create a subtle color transition while maintaining the established rhythm and adding a fresh dimension to the piece.
