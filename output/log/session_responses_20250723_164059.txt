Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I'm looking at a blank canvas, which presents an opportunity to create a dynamic abstract composition. I'll start with a bold, sweeping curve using the wiggle brush in a calming Keppel blue-green. This will create an organic, flowing line that will anchor the composition in the lower right quadrant of the canvas.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a single wiggly turquoise curve in the lower right corner of the canvas. To create an interesting dynamic composition, I'll add a complementary curved element using the wiggle brush in a contrasting wisteria purple. This new curve will mirror and respond to the existing one, creating a sense of dialogue and movement in the space.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice two mirrored wiggly curves on the canvas - one in wisteria purple on the left and one in keppel green on the right. To build on this balanced composition, I'll add a light sky blue curved element between them, creating a harmonious bridge that connects the two existing elements while adding a new color to the palette. This will enhance the rhythmic flow across the canvas.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "Looking at the three balanced wiggly curves across the canvas in wisteria, sky blue, and keppel, I want to create a harmonic upper complement to this arrangement. I'll place another wiggly curve using Light Red above the center sky blue curve, adding a warm accent that creates vertical tension and balance in the composition.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe four elegant wiggly curves arranged in a balanced composition - three in a row (purple, blue, and green) with a coral-colored curve floating above the center. To complete this rhythmic pattern, I'll add more floating curves above the purple and green curves, creating a cascading effect. I'll use the Jasmine yellow color to add warmth and contrast to the upper portion.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a beautiful arrangement of 6 wavy curves creating a harmonious pattern. To add visual interest and depth, I'll create a few gentle sprayed dots between the curves, particularly in the negative spaces between the upper and lower rows. This will add texture and depth to the composition while maintaining its airy, flowing quality.",
