Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice the canvas is completely blank, giving me a fresh start to express happiness! I want to start by drawing a big, cheerful sun in the upper right corner - suns are a classic symbol of joy and positive energy. I'll use the marker brush with warm yellow strokes to create radiating rays coming out from a circular center, positioned around coordinates (650,150) to leave space for other happy elements I might add later.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a start of something cheerful in the upper right with some marker strokes. To express more happiness, I want to add a fluffy, bouncy cloud using gentle, overlapping strokes to create a soft, playful feeling. I'll position it near coordinates (700,100) to complement the existing elements. Using a light, airy green color with the marker brush will give it a dreamy, joyful quality that matches the happy mood.",
