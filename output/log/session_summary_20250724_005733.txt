Thinking: I see a blank canvas, which gives us complete freedom to create! Let's start with something playful and organic - I'm thinking of drawing a whimsical flower using the wiggle brush to create natural, flowing lines. I'll start with a curved stem in a fresh Keppel green, positioning it slightly left of center to leave room for the bloom.
