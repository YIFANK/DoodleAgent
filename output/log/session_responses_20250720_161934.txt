Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "To express intensity, I'll create a dynamic burst of angular strokes emanating from a central point. I'll use bold red tones with sharp, aggressive movements that radiate outward, suggesting explosive energy and force. The strokes will start concentrated in the center around coordinates (425,250) and thrust outward in multiple directions with varying lengths.",
