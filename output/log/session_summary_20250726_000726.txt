Brush: wiggle
Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a blank canvas, and I feel inspired to start with something whimsical and organic. Let's create a flowing wave pattern using the wiggle brush in a calming sky blue color. I'll place it in the lower third of the canvas to establish a foundation for whatever we might add next. The wave will sweep gently from left to right with a natural undulation.

Brush: marker
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: The canvas has a light blue wiggling wave pattern at the bottom. To create a sense of rising movement and playfulness, I'll add some floating jasmine-colored bubbles or circles ascending from the wave. I'll use the marker brush to create varying sizes of circles that appear to float upward in a gentle diagonal pattern, creating a sense of lightness and movement.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice we have a beautiful composition developing with light blue wavy lines at the bottom and a soft yellow diagonal pattern floating above. To add more depth and playfulness, I'll create another wavy line that complements the existing bottom wave, but position it slightly higher and with a different rhythm. I'll use the wiggle brush again but this time with a wisteria purple to add a new color element that will create a nice contrast with both the blue and yellow elements.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the canvas, we have a lovely composition with blue waves at the bottom, yellow floating elements above, and a small purple wiggle accent. To enhance the overall flow and create more visual interest, I'd like to add another series of blue waves that follow a similar pattern to the ones at the bottom, but place them slightly higher up and make them a bit smaller. This will create a sense of depth and rhythm, suggesting movement like ripples in water.

Brush: marker
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice the canvas has a playful composition with blue waves at the bottom, yellow floating elements, and some purple accents. To build upon this dreamy, ethereal feeling, I'd like to add another gentle wave using the marker brush with a soft jasmine color near the top of the canvas. This will create a sense of warmth and light, almost like a soft glow or ray of sunshine streaming across the upper portion. The placement will balance the composition and complement the existing elements.
