Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas, which gives us complete freedom to start our abstract composition. I'll begin with a bold, sweeping curve in a calming Keppel color to create an organic foundation that will anchor future elements. This curve will start from the upper left quadrant and sweep down towards the center, creating a dynamic movement that invites the eye into the composition.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice a single mint-colored diagonal stroke in the upper portion of the canvas. To create an interesting abstract composition, I'll add a complementary diagonal line crossing the existing one, using a deep wisteria color to create a striking contrast. This will create a dynamic X-shaped focal point that can serve as the foundation for further abstract elements.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe two intersecting lines - one in wisteria purple and one in keppel mint green - creating an X-like formation in the center of the canvas. To build on this geometric composition, I'll add a horizontal wiggle line below in jasmine yellow to create a dynamic contrast. This will add movement and a new color dimension while maintaining balance. The wiggle will span roughly the same width as the existing lines but positioned lower on the canvas.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe two intersecting marker strokes in mint and purple creating an X-like form in the upper portion, with a yellow wavy line below. To balance this composition, I want to add a contrasting organic shape using the crayon brush in a soft red tone, positioning it in the lower right quadrant of the canvas. This will create a dynamic tension with the geometric lines above while adding a new textural element.",
