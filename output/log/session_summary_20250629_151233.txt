Brush: wiggle
Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Mood: pensive - To express 'pensive', I'll create a minimalist composition using gentle curves and flowing lines that suggest contemplation and inner reflection. I'll start with a soft, meandering line in the upper portion of the canvas that drifts downward, like a slowly descending thought. Using the wisteria color palette will help convey the dreamy, contemplative mood.
