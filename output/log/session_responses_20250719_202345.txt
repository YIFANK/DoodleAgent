Question: What would you like to draw next?

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I'm looking at a completely blank white canvas. Let's start with a bold, dynamic element that will serve as a focal point. I'll create a sweeping curve in Keppel blue-green that will flow from the upper left quadrant down towards the center, giving us a strong foundational element to build upon. The curve will have a graceful, organic quality that suggests movement and natural flow.",

Canvas: output/20250719_202359/canvas_step_1.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a single mint-colored curved stroke in the upper portion of the canvas. To create an interesting balanced composition, I'll add a complementary curved element below it, using a contrasting color from our palette. I'll use the Wisteria purple to create a harmonious tension with the existing mint stroke. This new stroke will mirror but not exactly copy the curve above, creating a sense of dynamic movement.",

Canvas: output/20250719_202359/canvas_step_2.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe two curved strokes on the canvas - one in a mint/Keppel color above and one in Wisteria purple below. To build on this emerging composition, I'll add a third curved stroke in a warm tone (Light Red) to create a dynamic, rhythmic pattern. I'll position it below the existing strokes, maintaining similar width but varying the curve slightly to create visual interest. This will complete a balanced trio of curved elements.",
