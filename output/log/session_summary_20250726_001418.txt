I'll add a gentle wave sequence using the wiggle brush with a medium sky blue tone, positioning it to create another layer of movement that will help define the space between the upper mist and lower waves. This will add to the peaceful rhythm while maintaining the dreamy atmosphere.

Thinking: I notice our seascape has developed a beautiful rhythm of waves and mist, but the upper right corner could use one final delicate touch to complete the composition. I'll add another gentle wave sequence using the wiggle brush with our lightest sky blue tone, positioning it higher than our previous waves to suggest the dissipation of water into mist. This will help create a natural transition between the misty areas and wave patterns while maintaining the ethereal quality of our scene.
