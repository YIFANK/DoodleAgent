  ],
  "reasoning": "The existing composition with its overlapping, translucent circles in soft pastels creates a naturally ethereal atmosphere. The gentle, organic movement of the wiggle brush at a slow speed (4) will complement this dreamy quality, adding a floating, ephemeral element that enhances the overall sense of lightness and otherworldliness. The careful weaving motion through the circles helps unify the composition while maintaining its delicate, ethereal nature."
