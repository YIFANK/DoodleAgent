Raw Response:
{
 “thinking”: “I see a blank canvas. I’m going to draw a simple landscape with a sun and some hills. I’ll start by adding a large U-shaped curve to represent a hill at the bottom of the canvas using the crayon brush in Jasmine color, making it look warm and inviting. This will create a nice base for the landscape.”,
