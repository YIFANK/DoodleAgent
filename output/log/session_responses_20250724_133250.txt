    "thinking": "Looking at the blank canvas, I feel inspired to start with something playful and organic. Let's create a flowing, wave-like pattern in the bottom third of the canvas using the wiggle brush. I'll use a calming Sky Blue color to establish a peaceful, water-inspired base that we can build upon. The wave will sweep across the canvas in a gentle undulating motion.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a light blue wavy line at the bottom of the canvas creating a gentle oceanic feel. To build upon this water theme, I'll add another wave pattern slightly above the existing one, creating a layered effect that suggests moving water. I'll use a darker shade of Sky Blue to create depth and visual interest. This second wave will be positioned about 50 pixels above the first one, maintaining a similar undulating rhythm but slightly offset to create a more natural, dynamic feel.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice two sky blue wiggly lines - one long wave at the bottom and a shorter one floating above. To complete this oceanic scene, I want to add some playful splashes or water droplets near the top using the same wiggle brush. I'll create a few small curved wiggles that appear to be floating upward, like water spray or sea mist. I'll place these elements in the upper portion of the canvas to balance the composition and maintain the aquatic theme.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a lovely ocean scene developing with a long wave at the bottom and several playful water droplets floating above. To enhance the sense of movement and depth, I'll add another long undulating wave line that sits between the bottom wave and the floating droplets. This middle wave will be shorter than the bottom one but longer than the current floating elements, helping to create a natural transition and suggesting multiple layers of water. I'll position it around y-coordinate 300 to maintain good spacing.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "The ocean scene is coming together nicely with multiple waves and playful water droplets. To complete the composition, I'll add one final wave in the middle section of the canvas that parallels the other waves. This will help fill the remaining space and create a more complete sense of flowing water. I'll position it between the two existing longer waves, around y-coordinate 280, making it slightly shorter than the bottom wave but still substantial enough to contribute to the overall fluid movement.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "Looking at the ocean scene with its multiple waves and floating droplets, I want to add a final rhythmic wave at the very bottom to complete the water effect. This wave will be positioned just below the longest existing wave, around y-coordinate 400, to create a solid foundation for the entire composition. Using the same Sky Blue color and wiggle brush will maintain consistency while adding another layer of flowing movement.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a beautiful ocean scene with multiple waves and playful water droplets. To add more depth and visual interest, I'll create one more gentle wave line in the bottom third of the canvas, just between two existing waves. This will help create a denser, more layered effect that really sells the feeling of moving water. I'll use the Sky Blue color to maintain consistency, positioning this new wave around y-coordinate 360 to fill a natural gap in the composition.",
