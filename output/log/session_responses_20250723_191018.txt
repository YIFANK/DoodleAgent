I'll use bold red colors and aggressive angular movements. Starting from the center of the canvas (around 425, 250), I'll draw multiple sharp, pointed lines radiating outward in different directions, resembling a spiky starburst pattern. The forceful, angular strokes will convey the intensity and volatility of anger.",
