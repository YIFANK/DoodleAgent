Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "The canvas is completely blank, offering a perfect opportunity to start a fresh composition. I'll begin by creating a gentle, sweeping curve in the lower portion of the canvas using a wiggle brush with a calming sky blue color. This will establish a flowing, dynamic base element that can anchor future additions.",
