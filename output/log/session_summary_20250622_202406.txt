------------------------------

[2025-06-22 20:26:48] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a playful yellow wiggle line near the bottom will create a balanced composition with the existing elements while adding dynamic movement. The slow timing creates a smooth, flowing curve that complements the other wavy lines.

------------------------------

[2025-06-22 20:27:03] Step

------------------------------

[2025-06-22 20:27:32] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #FF7878
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a light red wiggling line near the top of the composition will balance the existing bottom elements while maintaining the playful, wavelike pattern. The slow timing creates smooth undulations that complement the existing curves.

------------------------------

[2025-06-22 20:27:47] Step
Brush: wiggle
Color: #FF7878
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a light red wiggling line in the middle-lower section complements the existing wave patterns while maintaining the established visual rhythm. The slow timing creates smooth undulations that echo the existing strokes.

------------------------------

[2025-06-22 20:28:05] Step
Brush: marker
Color: #6BB9A4
