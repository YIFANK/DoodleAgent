  ],
  "reasoning": "Adding another gently undulating seaweed strand in the middle area using Keppel green helps create more underwater movement and depth. The wiggle brush creates a natural flowing effect, and the careful placement complements existing seaweed elements without overcrowding."

Raw Response:
{
  "brush": "wiggle",
  "color": "#6BB9A4",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [520, 540, 560, 580, 590, 600],
      "y": [340, 335, 340, 335, 340, 338],
      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "Gentle swaying seaweed tendril on right side"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Adding another gently undulating seaweed strand on the right side of the swimmer helps balance the composition and extends the underwater environment. The slow timing creates smooth, natural movement, while the Keppel green color maintains consistency with existing seaweed elements."
