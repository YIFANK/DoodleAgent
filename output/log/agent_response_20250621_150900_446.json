The slow timing (t=4) with the spray brush will create a gentle, atmospheric foundation that mirrors but doesn't compete with the bold rainbow circles above. This creates a sense of floating weightlessness while grounding the composition through symmetry.\n\nThe arc's path is carefully plotted to echo the curvature of the existing elements, creating a harmonious visual dialogue between the top and bottom portions of the canvas. The spray brush's particle-based nature also continues the dotted texture theme present in the black elements, but in a softer, more diffused way.",
