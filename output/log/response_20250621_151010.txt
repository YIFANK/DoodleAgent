Let me enhance this celestial rainbow arc with an ethereal spray of stardust that will add depth and cosmic energy to the composition.

"reasoning": "Creating ethereal depth beneath rainbow arc using delicate spray texture - slow timing builds nebulous atmosphere while following curved path of existing forms"
}

This addition will:
1. Add a subtle atmospheric layer beneath the existing rainbow circles
2. Create a sense of cosmic depth through gradual spray buildup
3. Echo the arc's graceful curve while adding textural complexity
4. Unify the composition with particle effects that complement the existing dotted elements
5. Enhance the dreamy, celestial quality through slow, intentional spray application

The slow timing values (4, 5) allow the spray particles to accumulate gradually, creating a more natural-looking cosmic dust effect that appears to float in space rather than feeling too dense or forced.
