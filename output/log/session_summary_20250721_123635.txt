Brush: spray
Color: default
Strokes: 2
Thinking: I see a blank canvas that's perfect for creating an abstract starry sky effect. I'll start with a spray brush to create scattered star-like dots across the upper portion of the canvas, creating a sense of depth and cosmic atmosphere. This will establish the foundation for a dreamy, celestial composition.

------------------------------

Brush: wiggle
Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe a beautiful spray pattern across the upper portion of the canvas, creating a nebula-like effect. To enhance this cosmic feeling, I'll add a gentle wiggle line below the spray pattern that will suggest a celestial wave or cosmic current. I'll use Sky Blue to create a cool, ethereal feeling that complements the scattered dots above.

------------------------------

Brush: wiggle
Color: #288AAB
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice a stunning cosmic composition with a dense spray of dots creating a nebulous effect in the upper portion, complemented by a light blue wiggling line below. To add more depth and movement, I'll create another gentle wiggle line slightly below the existing one, using a darker shade of Sky Blue. This will create a sense of cosmic waves or celestial currents flowing through space.

------------------------------
