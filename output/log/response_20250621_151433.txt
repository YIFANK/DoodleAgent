I'll add a complementary flowing rainbow arc to mirror and enhance the existing circular patterns, creating a sense of dynamic movement and harmony.

{
  "brush": "rainbow",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [50, 200, 425, 650, 800],
      "y": [400, 300, 250, 300, 400],
      "t": [4, 4, 4, 4],
      "description": "Rainbow flow arch"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Added flowing rainbow arc in lower canvas zone (Y:250-400) to create symmetry with existing patterns. Slow timing (t=4) for smooth color transitions and elegant flow."
}

The rainbow brush will create a beautiful flowing arch that complements the existing circular patterns while adding new colors and movement to the lower portion of the canvas. The slow timing values ensure smooth transitions between points, allowing the rainbow colors to blend naturally. The positioning creates a sense of balance with the existing elements while adding a new dynamic layer to the composition.
