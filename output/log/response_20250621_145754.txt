I'll add a playful rainbow arc to complement and complete the existing pastel circle arrangement, creating a full rainbow bridge effect.

  "brush": "rainbow",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [200, 425, 650],
      "y": [400, 300, 400],
      "t": [4, 4],
      "description": "rainbow bridge"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Adding a flowing rainbow arc beneath the pastel circles creates a complete bridge shape and adds movement"
}
