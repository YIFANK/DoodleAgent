Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas, which gives us complete freedom to start our abstract composition. I'd like to begin with a bold, sweeping gesture using the wiggle brush in a calming Keppel color. This will create an organic, flowing line that will anchor our composition in the lower right quadrant, suggesting movement and energy.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice a nearly blank canvas with just a tiny mark in the bottom right. Let's start bold by creating a dynamic diagonal sweep across the canvas using the marker brush in a rich Wisteria purple. This will establish a strong directional energy from top-left to bottom-right, activating the space and creating a foundation for our composition. The stroke will be thick and confident, starting near the top-left third and sweeping down to echo but not directly connect with that existing small mark.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a delicate teal wiggle line in the bottom right and a soft wisteria-colored circle in the upper portion. To create an interesting dynamic composition, I'll add a contrasting jasmine-colored curved stroke that starts from the middle-left and sweeps upward, creating a sense of movement and balance with the existing elements.",
