Brush: marker
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 3
Thinking: The canvas is empty, providing a perfect opportunity to start a simple nature scene. I will draw a stylized sun in the top-left corner. I'll use the marker brush with the recommended Jasmine color to create a bright, cheerful effect. The sun will be a series of lines radiating from a central point to represent the sun's rays.

Brush: crayon
Color: #B2DEED
Strokes: 2
Thinking: Now that the sun is in place, I'll draw a cloud using the crayon brush with a light Sky Blue color. I'll place it to the right of the sun to complement the sunny scene, adding a casual, breezy feel.

Brush: crayon
Color: #B2DEED
Strokes: 2
Thinking: To enhance the nature scene, I'll add another cloud below the existing one. I'll use the crayon brush with a light Sky Blue color. This will balance the composition and add depth to the sky.

Brush: marker
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To continue building the nature scene, I'll add a simple tree on the left side of the canvas, below the sun. I'll use the marker brush with a Keppel color for the leaves and the fountain brush for the trunk. This will add an element of greenery and complete the scene harmoniously.

Brush: fountain
Color: default
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To complete the tree, I will add the trunk using the fountain brush with its default black color. I'll draw a vertical line centered under the leaves to represent the trunk, making the scene feel balanced and realistic.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FF7878
Strokes: 3
Thinking: To add more life to the scene, I think a few colorful flowers at the base of the tree would be lovely. I'll use the wiggle brush with Tea Rose (Red) for the petals and Jasmine for the center. This will bring vibrant colors and enhance the natural aspect of the scene.

Brush: crayon
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: To enhance the scene even further, I'll add some grass at the base of the tree. Using the crayon brush with the default Keppel color, I'll create a small patch of grass around the flowers to give a more grounded feel to the scene.
