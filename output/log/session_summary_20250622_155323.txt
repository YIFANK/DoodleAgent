Brush: pen
Color: #000000
Strokes: 4
Reasoning: Starting with a classic happy face doodle - it's simple, cheerful, and a perfect way to begin. Using pen for clean lines and planning the face shape with a gentle curve, then adding simple dot eyes and a smile below.

Brush: marker
Color: #000000
Strokes: 1
Reasoning: Adding a gentle rolling hill or ground line in the lower portion of the canvas using the semi-transparent orange marker. This will create a nice base for the composition and connect all the floating elements above. The curve flows naturally from left to right with gentle ups and downs.
