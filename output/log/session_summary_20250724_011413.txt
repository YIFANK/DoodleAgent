Brush: marker
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I'm feeling joyful and want to start drawing a bright, cheerful sun! The sun is a perfect symbol of happiness and warmth. I'll begin by creating the main circle of the sun in the upper left portion of the canvas, using a warm Jasmine yellow color with the marker brush for a bold, vibrant effect. This will be the focal point that radiates positive energy across the canvas.

------------------------------

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 6
Thinking: I see a cheerful yellow sun in the upper left! To express more happiness, I'll add playful sunrays radiating outward from the sun using a wiggle brush. The wavy lines will create a sense of energy and joy, suggesting warmth and light spreading across the canvas. I'll use the same Jasmine yellow to maintain consistency, but the wiggle brush will add a fun, dynamic quality that matches my happy mood.

Brush: crayon
Color: #FFF6CA
Strokes: 1
Thinking: The cheerful sun is looking wonderful with its playful rays! To enhance the happy feeling, I want to add some light, dreamy clouds using the crayon brush. I'll place them near the sun to create a soft, joyful atmosphere. The cloud will have a gentle, fluffy appearance which adds to the peaceful, happy mood. I'll use a very light Jasmine color to make it appear soft and airy.

Brush: marker
Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at the cheerful sun and soft clouds, I want to add a joyful rainbow arc emerging from behind the cloud to symbolize happiness and optimism! I'll start with a wisteria purple arc, which will be the first band of our rainbow. The curved stroke will sweep gracefully from below the cloud, creating a beautiful arch that will add more positive energy to the scene. The placement will start around x=180 and curve downward and to the right, making a natural continuation from our existing elements.

Brush: marker
Color: #FFD1D1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: The canvas has a beautiful sun with radiating rays, soft clouds, and the start of a rainbow with a purple arc. To continue expressing joy and happiness, I'd like to add another band of the rainbow using the Tea Rose color. This warm, gentle pink will complement the purple perfectly and add to the cheerful mood. I'll draw it parallel to the existing purple arc, maintaining the same graceful curve but slightly offset to create that classic rainbow effect.

Brush: marker
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: The canvas has a delightful sun, wiggly rays, soft clouds, and the beginning of a rainbow with purple and pink bands. To enhance the joyful feeling, I want to add a cheerful yellow band to our rainbow using the Jasmine color. This bright, happy yellow will add more radiance and optimism to our rainbow sequence. I'll draw it parallel to the existing bands, maintaining the same graceful curve but slightly offset, creating a beautiful tricolor effect that radiates pure happiness.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: Looking at our cheerful scene with the sun, clouds, and beautiful rainbow, I want to add some playful butterflies dancing near the rainbow to enhance the joyful atmosphere! I'll use the wiggle brush to create a whimsical butterfly path, showing its fluttering motion near the rainbow's arc. The butterfly's trail will be in Sky Blue to contrast beautifully with the warm colors of our rainbow and add a sense of lightness and freedom to the composition. I'll place it near the upper portion of the rainbow, suggesting it's playing in the sunny sky.

Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: The canvas has such a joyful scene with a sun, rainbow, and a playful butterfly! To add more whimsical energy, I want to create another butterfly friend using the wiggle brush, this time placing it a bit lower on the rainbow. I'll use the Sky Blue color again to maintain harmony, but position this butterfly on a different flight path to suggest a cheerful dance between the two butterflies. This will add to the feeling of movement and joy in our happy scene.

Thinking: Looking at our delightful scene with the sun, rainbow, and dancing butterflies, I want to add some sparkles of joy around the sun area! I'll use the wiggle brush to create tiny spiral-like sparkles that radiate pure happiness. These sparkles will be in a light Wisteria purple to add a magical, cheerful touch to the sunny area. I'll place them strategically around the sun's rays to enhance the feeling of joyful energy emanating from our happy sun.

Strokes: 3
Thinking: Our joyful scene is coming together beautifully with the sun, rainbow, butterflies, and sparkles! To add even more cheerful energy, I want to create some happy little wiggly sunbeams dancing from the top of our rainbow. Using the wiggle brush with bright Jasmine yellow, I'll add these playful rays that seem to bounce off the rainbow's peak, expressing pure joy and celebration. These rays will create a sense of radiating happiness from where the rainbow meets the sky.

Thinking: Looking at our whimsical scene with the sun, rainbow, butterflies, and sparkles, I want to add some cheerful cloud puffs floating near the right side of our rainbow! To balance the composition and add more joyful elements, I'll use the marker brush with a soft Sky Blue color to create fluffy, happy clouds that seem to dance alongside our rainbow. These clouds will add a sense of lightness and playfulness to the scene, while also providing a beautiful contrast to the warm colors.

To amplify this happy feeling, I want to add a playful swirl of happy stars trailing down near the end of the rainbow.

I'll create a happy trail of bouncing hearts using the wiggle brush with Light Red near the bottom of our rainbow.

Thinking: The scene is filled with such joyful elements! To add even more playful energy, I want to create another little butterfly dancing near the bottom right of our rainbow.

This will add to the sense of carefree happiness and movement in our scene, while balancing the composition by adding another delightful element to the lower right area.
