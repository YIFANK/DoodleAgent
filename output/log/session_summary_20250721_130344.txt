Brush: marker
Color: #6BB9A4
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a blank canvas - an opportunity to create something dynamic and energetic. I'll start with a bold, sweeping curve in a soothing Keppel tone that will anchor the composition in the lower left quadrant. This will create a strong foundation and suggest movement across the canvas.

Brush: wiggle
Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe a gentle mint-colored curve in the lower left area. To create an interesting abstract composition, I'll add a complementary upward-sweeping curve using the wiggle brush in Wisteria purple. This will create a dynamic interplay with the existing curve while adding textural contrast. The new curve will be placed slightly offset and above the first one, suggesting an ethereal, floating quality.

Brush: spray
Color: default
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I see a mint green curved form with a playful purple wiggle line dancing above it. To build on this emerging composition, I'll use the spray brush to create a cloud-like texture that will float above and to the right of the existing elements. This will add depth and atmospheric quality to the piece, while maintaining the established diagonal flow. The spray pattern will help transition the eye from the defined curves to a more ethereal space.
