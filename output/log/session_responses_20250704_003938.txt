Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a blank white canvas - a perfect opportunity to start with something bold and dynamic. I'll create a sweeping, energetic curve using the wiggle brush in a vibrant Keppel color. This will establish an organic, flowing movement across the canvas, starting from the lower left and arcing upward towards the right, creating a sense of ascension and movement.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a pristine white canvas with a tiny dot in the lower left. I'll start with a bold, sweeping gesture using the marker brush in a calming Keppel blue-green shade. I'll create a dynamic curved stroke that starts from the upper left quadrant and swoops down toward the center, establishing an energetic focal point and directional movement that will guide the composition.",

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe a delicate teal wiggle line ascending diagonally across the lower portion of the canvas, and a subtle mint-colored circle in the upper left. To create visual balance and intrigue, I'll add a complementary curved element in wisteria purple that echoes but contrasts with the existing strokes. I'll place this new element in the upper right quadrant to create diagonal tension with the existing elements.",
