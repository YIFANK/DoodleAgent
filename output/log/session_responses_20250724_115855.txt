    "thinking": "I see a blank canvas, which gives us complete freedom to create! Let's start with something playful and organic - I'm thinking of drawing a whimsical flower using the wiggle brush. We'll start in the middle-left portion of the canvas with a gentle curved stem, then add a cheerful bloom on top.",

Raw Response:

    "thinking": "I notice we have the beginning of a whimsical yellow flower with a curvy stem and some petals starting to form. To build on this organic design, let's add some additional playful petals to complete the flower head using the wiggle brush. I'll place these on the right side of the existing petals to create a fuller, more balanced bloom.",

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I notice we have a delicate yellow flower taking shape with a curved stem and some overlapping petals. To enhance the natural, organic feel, I'd like to add a playful leaf sprouting from the stem. I'll use the wiggle brush again to maintain consistency, placing the leaf about halfway up the stem with a gentle curve that suggests movement.",
