Question: What would you like to draw next?
Canvas: output/20250629_140121/canvas_step_0.png
Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
I'll draw a cheerful sun in the top corner of this blank canvas using warm colors to bring some life to it.

  "brush": "marker",
  "color": "#FFE978",
  "strokes": [
    {
      "x": [100, 150, 200, 150, 100, 50, 100],
      "y": [100, 50, 100, 150, 100, 100, 100],
      "t": [1, 3],
      "description": "Circle for sun body"
    },
    {
      "x": [50, 200, 50, 200, 125, 125, 75, 175],
      "y": [50, 150, 150, 50, 25, 175, 100, 100],
      "t": [1, 2],
      "description": "Sun rays extending outward"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Starting with a cheerful sun will set a positive tone for the canvas. Using the Jasmine yellow color creates a warm, inviting feeling. The circular motion for the sun's body followed by radiating lines creates a classic sun design that can serve as a focal point for additional elements."
