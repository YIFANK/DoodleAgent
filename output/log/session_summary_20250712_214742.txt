Thinking: I see a blank white canvas - a perfect opportunity to start with a bold, dynamic element. I'll create a sweeping curved line using the wiggle brush in a calming Keppel tone, starting from the upper left area and flowing down towards the center. This will establish an organic, flowing movement that c

Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe a single wavy turquoise line in the upper portion of the canvas, drawn with the wiggle brush. To create an interesting counterpoint, I'll add a complementary wavy line below it using a warmer color from our palette. The new line will mirror the rhythm but use Tea Rose red to create a pleas

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice two wavy lines on the canvas - one in Keppel (turquoise) in the upper portion and one in Light Red (pink) below it. To create an interesting composition, I'll add a third complementary wavy line using Jasmine yellow. I'll position it near the bottom of the canvas to create a balanced, desce

Color: #CF94EE
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe three wavy lines on the canvas - a turquoise one near the top, a pink one in the middle, and a yellow one near the bottom. To create an interesting rhythm and visual balance, I'll add a fourth wavy line in Wisteria purple that floats between the pink and yellow lines. This will create a ha

Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe four wavy lines arranged in a diagonal cascade from top-left to bottom-right, in Keppel, Tea Rose, Wisteria, and Jasmine colors. To create a balanced composition, I'll add a complementary Sky Blue wavy line above the current pattern, creating a harmonious sequence of five lines. This will

Brush: wiggle
Color: #FF7878
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice a pattern of wavy lines cascading across the canvas in various colors (sky blue, keppel, pink, wisteria, and jasmine). To complete this rhythmic composition, I'll add another wavy line that follows the diagonal flow but fills an empty space in the bottom left area around coordinates (100-40

Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice a pleasing arrangement of wavy lines across the canvas creating a musical, rhythmic feel. To complement this composition, I'll add another sky blue wiggle line in the center-left area around coordinates (150-450, 250). This will help balance the composition by filling an empty space and con
