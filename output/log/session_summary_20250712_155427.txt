Thinking: I see a blank white canvas, which gives us complete freedom to start our abstract composition. I'll begin with a bold, sweeping gesture using the wiggle brush in a calming Keppel shade. This will create an organic, flowing line that moves diagonally across the canvas from upper left to lower right,

Thinking: I observe a single wavy diagonal line in Keppel green moving from upper left to lower right. To create an interesting counterpoint, I'll add a complementary wavy line in wisteria purple that moves from lower left to upper right, intersecting with the existing line. This will create dynamic tension a

Color: #FFE978
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe two intersecting wavy diagonal lines - one in Keppel green descending from left to right, and one in Wisteria purple ascending from left to right. To build on this composition, I'll add another wavy line in yellow (Jasmine) that will create a dynamic triangular relationship. This new line

Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe two intersecting diagonal elements - a wavy Keppel green line and a dotted line in alternating Jasmine yellow and Wisteria purple. To create balance and visual interest, I'll add a mirroring wave pattern in Sky Blue starting from the top right corner, creating a triangular negative space b

Thinking: I notice the composition has two main diagonal elements - a Keppel green wavy line intersecting with a pattern of alternating Jasmine yellow and Wisteria purple circles with a Sky Blue wavy line following it. To balance this composition, I'll add a red element using the Light Red palette that echoes

Thinking: I observe an interesting composition with intersecting diagonal elements - a wavy Keppel green line crossing with a dotted/circular pattern in yellow and purple, transitioning to sky blue and coral red waves. To balance this composition, I'll add a complementary wave pattern in wisteria purple that

Thinking: I observe an interesting composition with intersecting diagonal wiggly lines in various colors (Keppel green, wisteria purple, jasmine yellow, sky blue, and light red). To balance the composition, I'll add a complementary curved element in tea rose red that echoes the existing curves but creates a n

Color: #FFD1D1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe an interesting composition of intersecting wiggly lines creating a dynamic flow across the canvas. To enhance this rhythmic pattern, I'll add a complementary wiggle stroke in Tea Rose red that will curve upward from the bottom-left corner (around 100,450) toward the center-left area (300,2

Color: #FF9595
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I observe an elegant composition of intersecting wiggly lines in various pastel colors. To add more dynamic energy, I'll create a new wiggly line that starts from the bottom left corner and curves upward toward the center, using the Light Red color to add warmth and contrast to the cool tones alread

Brush: wiggle
Color: #7FC9E1
Strokes: 1
Thinking: I notice the composition has several intersecting diagonal wiggly lines in pastel colors. To add visual interest and balance, I'll create a new wiggle stroke in Sky Blue that parallels the existing lines but adds a fresh dynamic element. I'll place it in the upper left quadrant where there's open sp
