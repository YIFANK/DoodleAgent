Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I see a gentle wavy line in Keppel green at the bottom of the canvas, suggesting a simple landscape horizon. To build on this serene scene, I'll add some clouds in the sky area using the same color but positioned higher up.

Parsing Success: True

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I see a gentle wavy landscape forming in Keppel green. To complement these existing waves and create more depth, I'll add another curvy line in darker Keppel that suggests rolling hills or waves in a lower position. This will help build a layered, organic composition. I'll place it slightly below and to the right of the existing bottom wave, using a darker shade to create depth.",

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I notice a series of gentle, wavy lines in Keppel green that suggest a serene landscape. To enhance this scene, I'll add some floating birds in the sky using the wiggle brush.

Raw Response:
{
  "thinking": "I observe several wavy lines in Keppel green creating what appears to be a minimalist landscape or seascape. To enhance this composition, I'll add a complementary wavy line in Sky Blue near the top right portion, suggesting clouds or distant waves.

Raw Response:

  "thinking": "I notice a serene landscape developing with wavy lines primarily in Keppel green and a touch of Sky Blue in the upper right. The composition suggests a rolling landscape or gentle waves. To enhance this, I'll add another wavy line element in Sky Blue to balance the composition and create a sense of depth. I'll place this in the middle-right area to bridge existing elements.",
