I notice there's an abstract design with orange wiggly lines and soft circular marker dots in a pale peach color. I'll add some complementary elements to enhance the composition's flow and energy.

  ],
  "reasoning": "Added sweeping rainbow stroke to complement existing orange curves, positioned in lower-mid canvas to create dynamic movement and color contrast. Slow timing for smooth flow."
}

This rainbow stroke will add a vibrant, flowing element that mirrors and responds to the existing orange wiggly lines while introducing more color variety. The slow timing values (4) will create a smooth, graceful motion that harmonizes with the piece's organic nature.
