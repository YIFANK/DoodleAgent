This will use the marker brush with the darkest shade of Sky Blue (#0D2E39), representing the heaviest, most concentrated form of sorrow. The teardrop will be larger than the others, suggesting how sadness can grow and become overwhelming. I'll add slight transparency to create depth and let it interact with the existing elements, showing how our deepest sorrows can blend with and amplify each other.",

I'll use the wiggle brush with the lightest Sky Blue shade (#E5F4F9) to create gentle, trembling lines in the upper portion of the canvas. These lines will be shorter and more hesitant than the existing ones, expressing that moment when emotions are so overwhelming that even tears struggle to form. I'll place them near the top right where there's still space, creating a sense of vulnerability and emotional fragility.",
