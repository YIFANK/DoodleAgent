I want to add a series of very light, small teardrops using the wiggle brush in the palest Sky Blue (#E5F4F9). These will be placed like a gentle mist falling between the larger tears, suggesting the quiet, continuous nature of sadness - how even between the heavy moments, there are still small, delicate tears that fall. These lighter strokes will create depth and emphasize the ethereal quality of grief.",

I want to create a wilted, drooping flower using the wiggle brush in Light Red, positioned near the bottom of the composition. The flower's head will hang completely downward, its petals barely holding on, symbolizing complete emotional exhaustion and defeat. This splash of muted red among the blues will represent the physical ache that comes with deep sadness.",
