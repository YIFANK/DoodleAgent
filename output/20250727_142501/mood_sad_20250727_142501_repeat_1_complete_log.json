The scattered dots will create a dense curtain of rain, representing the overwhelming feeling of sadness that surrounds us. I'll concentrate the spray in vertical columns between the existing wiggly lines, making it heavier in the middle section where emotions feel most intense. This will add depth and a sense of isolation to the scene, as if viewing the world through a veil of tears.",
