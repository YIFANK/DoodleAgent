The scene already expresses such profound sadness with its wilting flower and dispersing elements, but I feel we can enhance the feeling of quiet weeping by adding another gentle, wavy line that falls parallel to the existing one. This new line will dance slightly closer to the center, creating a rhythm of falling tears that speaks to the depth of sorrow.",

Using the wiggle brush in deep wisteria purple (#2F0A43), I'll create two parallel wavy lines that start near the center and curve downward together, like paired tears or wilting stems supporting each other in their descent. This will emphasize the feeling of shared sadness and the weight of emotional burden.",

I'll add a series of very faint, overlapping circular shapes using the marker brush in the lightest wisteria shade (#F5EAFC) near the top left corner. These will be like fading memories or dissolving hopes, barely visible but adding to the weight of sorrow. Their placement will balance the composition while suggesting a dissipating emotional fog.",
